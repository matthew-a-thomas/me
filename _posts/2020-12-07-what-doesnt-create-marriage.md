Is a marriage certificate necessary? Is a marriage only valid in a church? Does
a marriage exist only after physical intimacy?

This post will be brief and limited. Maybe I'll flesh these things out later.
I'm learning what the Bible says about marriage, divorce, and remarriage and
wanted to jot down some things.

## Marriage certificates

They aren't strictly necessary. They fall under "obeying the governing
authorities" but a marriage can still technically exist without them.

Trivially, marriages have been around longer than marriage certificates.

Okay, sure my state wasn't even a state when the Bible was written, but what
about older equivalents to government-issued certificates? Well, if you can find
civil government's involvement in Genesis 2 then you're a better man than me.

## Church

It isn't strictly necessary to get married by a church.

Again, many marriages in the Bible happened outside of any religious context yet
were still considered valid.

For example, {% include verse.html verse="1 Corinthians 7:12&ndash;13" %} talks
about believing people having unbelieving spouses. The unbelieving spouses
wouldn't be spouses at all if the marriage were only valid in the context of the
church. Jesus commanded faithfulness in marriages
({% include verse.html verse="Matthew 5:32" %};
{% include verse.html verse="Matthew 19:9"%}) that existed prior to the New
Testament Church. And there are other examples in the Bible of marriages
performed with very little fanfare and even without involvement by religious
authorities.

## Intercourse

Biblical marriage must exist prior to intercourse. That's clear from 1
Corinthians 7. In the Bible's terms intercourse outside of marriage is not good.
And Paul said it's better to get married than burn with passion, because in
marriage there is a God-ordained outlet for the passion.

In other words there's room for intercourse only _after_ marriage. So that can't
be what creates a marriage

## The point

None of these things are what create a marriage.
