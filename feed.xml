<a href="/programming/2020/10/27/making-primes-rust.html">Making Prime Numbers in Rust</a>
I explained how to make a prime number generator. It used trial division. You’ll
notice that I don’t bother trying to divide the candidate number by any prime
larger than its square root.</p>

<p>Why the square root?</p>

<h2 id="graphical-answer">Graphical answer</h2>

<div class="d-flex flex-column">
  <div>100 divided by <span id="divisor-output">10</span></div>
  <input type="range" id="divisor" min="1" value="10" />
  <div>...equals <span id="quotient-output">10</span></div>
  <input type="range" id="quotient" min="1" step="0.1" value="10" disabled="" />
</div>
<script>
  const divisor = document.getElementById('divisor');
  const divisorOutput = document.getElementById('divisor-output');
  const quotient = document.getElementById('quotient');
  const quotientOutput = document.getElementById('quotient-output');
  function updateQuotient() {
    quotient.value = 100 / divisor.value;
    divisorOutput.innerHTML = divisor.value;
    quotientOutput.innerHTML = quotient.value;
  }
  divisor.addEventListener('input', updateQuotient);
</script>

<p><br />
Play with the top slider for a bit.</p>

<p>Do you get it yet?</p>

<p>Here’s a hint: once you’ve figured out that \(100 \div 2 = 50\), you then also
know that \(100 \div 50 = 2\). There’s no need to also divide by 50 because you
already know that answer.</p>

<p>The same goes for all these:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>100 divided by</th>
      <th>equals</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>50</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>33.3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>20</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>14.3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>11</td>
      <td>9.1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>13</td>
      <td>7.7</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>17</td>
      <td>5.9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>19</td>
      <td>5.3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>What do you notice about each of those pairs of numbers?</p>

<p>The square root is always at least as large as one of them.</p>

<p>Once you’ve divided by primes up through the square root then you already know
the answers for all the primes larger than the square root. So there’s no need
to also divide by those larger primes.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="numbers" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why square roots are used in trial division]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dynamically Generated Type</title><link href="/programming/2022/02/22/generated-type.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dynamically Generated Type" /><published>2022-02-22T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-02-22T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>/programming/2022/02/22/generated-type</id><content type="html" xml:base="/programming/2022/02/22/generated-type.html"><![CDATA[<p>There are a variety of ways to interact with C#’s type system.

<em>traits</em>. But what are they? How do they compare to C#’s interfaces?</p>

<p>In a nutshell, a trait is like a C# interface:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple types can implement it</li>
  <li>You can write code that abstracts over it</li>
  <li>You can do dynamic dispatch with it</li>
  <li>You can write default methods for it</li>
</ul>

<p>…but it is also <em>not</em> like a C# interface:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can implement a trait for a foreign type</li>
  <li>A trait can have associated types</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s look at each of these in turn.</p>

<h2 id="like-a-c-interface">Like a C# interface</h2>

<p>The similarities are simple. So I’ll go quick.</p>

<h3 id="multiple-types-can-implement-it">Multiple types can implement it</h3>

<p>In C#, multiple types can implement an interface:</p>

<h3 id="you-can-write-default-methods-for-it">You can write default methods for it</h3>

<p>One of the recent versions of C# added default interface implementations. I’m
writing this off the cuff, but I think it looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">interface</span> <span class="nc">IFoo</span>

<p>It’s very similar in Rust:</p>

<h2 id="not-like-a-c-interface">Not like a C# interface</h2>

<p>In my opinion this is where Rust’s trait system really begins to shine.</p>

<h3 id="you-can-implement-a-trait-for-a-foreign-type">You can implement a trait for a foreign type</h3>

<p>In C#, when you use a type from some package you found on Nuget or in the

they decided to implement on that type.</p>

<p>But the adapter pattern comes with a cost. Do you see all the boilerplate? We
were trying to follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle">Interface Segregation Principle</a>
which says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones
  so that <strong>clients will only have to know about the methods that are of
  interest to them</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed we were following it, because the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IReadableIndex&lt;T&gt;</code> interface exposes
the absolute minimum surface area needed for our “important stuff” method. But
to do so we had to introduce a <em>lot</em> of boilerplate!</p>

<p>Rust makes this much easier!</p>

<p>(The astute reader will notice that Rust already has <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ops/trait.Index.html">this trait</a>)</p>

<p>Did you notice how it was possible to implement the trait for <em>foreign</em> types?
It doesn’t matter that we don’t have access to the source code of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[T; N]</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>. We could still make those types implement this trait, and we didn’t
have to introduce any additional types!</p>

<p>It is often much easier in Rust to <em>tailor interfaces to consumers</em>.</p>

<p>To me it seems Microsoft has fallen in love with a form of programming by
convention which they usually apply
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-8.0/ranges#implicit-range-support">like this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The language will provide an instance indexer member with a single parameter
  of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Range</code> for types which meet the following criteria:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The type is Countable.</li>
    <li>The type has an accessible member named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Slice</code> which has two parameters of
  type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code>.</li>
    <li>The type does not have an instance indexer which takes a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Range</code> as
  the first parameter. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Range</code> must be the only parameter or the remaining
  parameters must be optional.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For such types, the language will bind as if there is an indexer member of the
  form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T this[Range range]</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> is the return type of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Slice</code> method
  including any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref</code> style annotations. The new member will also have matching
  accessibility with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Slice</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ignore the minutiae. The thing I want you to notice is how they didn’t bother to
give us an interface for this new functionality. Instead they said “if you put
this here and name this other thing a certain way then the compiler will
magically do this”. <em>They gave us no help with abstracting over this behavior in
C#.</em> If you wanted to write code that would work for “range-aware” types then
you’d have to create an interface and adapters for all the different types. (And
once you’ve done that then who cares about <em>implicit</em> range support?)</p>

<p>The benefit that Rust’s traits would bring to this situation is there would be
far less boilerplate and <em>no additional types</em> needed to abstract over the very
same feature! Actually, they have already
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ops/trait.Index.html#impl-Index%3CI%3E-1">done</a>
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ops/struct.Range.html#impl-SliceIndex%3C%5BT%5D%3E">this</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-trait-can-have-associated-types">A trait can have associated types</h3>

<p>In C#, an interface may have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Methods</li>
  <li>Properties (which are just syntax sugar for methods)</li>
</ul>

<p>But in Rust, a trait may have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Methods</li>
  <li>Associated types</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, how would you represent this in C#?</p>

<p>Rust’s associated types are great for hiding generic types in certain
situations. You can even have associated <em>constants</em> (although support for that

I’ve always wanted
more lights and outlets than the current circuits can handle. And plus I’m
beginning to need 240V for power tools.</p>

<p>As I plan ahead I’m having to learn about all the different outlets, wire
gauges, breakers, and circuits related to both 120V and 240V.</p>

<p>One thing I’m learning about is something called a multi-wire branch circuit
(MWBC).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-mwbc">What is a MWBC</h2>

<p>A MWBC gives you two circuits that are out of phase and share a neutral.</p>

<p>Here in the United States the electrical service that comes into your house is
essentially a MWBC. Generally half of the 120V appliances will be on one leg and
the other half will be on the other leg. Bigger appliances that require 240V
service, like an electric stove or HVAC system, will be wired across both legs.
Like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Transformer | Electrical panel | Appliances

+120V ------ ------------------ ---+-------------+
                                    \             \
                                     | Fridge      |
                                    /              |
Neutral ---- ------------------ ---+               | Stove
                                    \              |
                                     | Microwave   |
                                    /             /
-120V ------ ------------------ ---+-------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice how the 120V fridge and microwave share a common neutral?</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>It’s important that the two 120V legs are exactly out of phase. When they are
out of phase then the neutral line only has to carry the <em>difference</em> in current
between the two legs. But if the two legs are in phase then it has to carry the
<em>sum</em> of the currents.</p>

<p>In a MWBC (where the 120V legs are out of phase) you can use the same gauge wire
for the neutral as for the two legs. In other words you can use a single 12/3
copper wire to feed two 20A 120V circuits. The highest load the neutral will see
is when one leg is using a lot of current and the other is using none.
Paradoxically, the neutral will see zero current when both legs are using
exactly the same amount of current.</p>

<p>But if the legs were in phase then the neutral would have to be sized to carry
twice the capacity of the legs. The highest load the neutral would see in that
case is when both legs are using a lot of current. And the neutral would only
ever see zero current when neither leg is using any current.</p>

<p>Here’s why: in a MWBC if the two legs are using the same amount of current then
the same amount of current will be flowing into one leg as <em>out</em> the other,
because they are exactly out of phase. But if they were in phase then the same
amount of current would be flowing into one leg as <em>into</em> the other, and those
two currents have nowhere to go but through the neutral.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-make-one">How do you make one?</h2>

<p>Pick an amperage, like 20A. Get a 20A double pole breaker and some 12/3 (which
is rated for 20A) and a NEMA 5-20 (which is rated for 120V 20A) duplex outlet.
The 12/3 will have four conductors in it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Black - one 120V leg</li>
  <li>White - neutral</li>
  <li>Red - the other 120V leg</li>
  <li>Bare copper - ground</li>
</ul>

<p>Because you’re using a double pole breaker then the black and red lines will be
out of phase.</p>

<p>Break the hot tab on your duplex outlet so that the hot side of the two
receptacles are no longer electrically connected.</p>

<p>Then wire it like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Black -&gt; one receptacle</li>
  <li>Neutral -&gt; shared neutral</li>
  <li>Red -&gt; the other receptacle</li>
  <li>Ground -&gt; shared ground</li>
</ul>

<p>Tada! You now have an outlet that can pump 20A out of both receptacles at once!</p>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<p>In addition to all the rules for normal wiring, a MWBC additionally has these
requirements:</p>

<p>When you flip a breaker it has to turn off both legs. This is to prevent any
nasty surprises when someone flips the breaker to do work inside the outlet’s
box—you want both legs to be dead, not just one of them. A double pole
breaker solves this.</p>

<p>You also must take care that you don’t lose the neutral. If you want a MWBC to
feed multiple outlets (not just multiple receptacles, but multiple outlets in a
room) then you have to wire them together in a way that keeps the neutral
connected for all the other outlets if you remove an outlet, or if the neutral
breaks or falls off of an outlet. If you lose the neutral on our example MWBC
above then there will still be 240V between the two hot sides of the receptacles
exactly as there was before. Which in theory is fine without the neutral if both
receptacles are pulling the exact same amount of current. But as soon as there
is a current imbalance then there will be a voltage imbalance—one device
might see 200V while the other only sees 40V—a good way to start a fire.
You also get odd behavior such as lights only working while the toaster is on.
Wiring the outlets in with pigtails helps to keep the integrity of the neutral
line independent of the integrity of the outlet.</p>

<h2 id="the-point">The point</h2>

<p>A MWBC has to be wired properly to work. But it can be a useful way to get lots
of power out of a single duplex outlet. Or a useful way to put a NEMA 6-20
outlet in the same box as a duplex NEMA 5-20 outlet with only a single 12/3
wire.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="diy" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learn with me]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Radial Arm Saw</title><link href="/tools/2021/10/12/ras.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Radial Arm Saw" /><published>2021-10-12T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-10-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/tools/2021/10/12/ras</id><content type="html" xml:base="/tools/2021/10/12/ras.html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently purchased a radial arm saw (RAS) from Craigslist.</p>

<p>Here’s almost what it looks like:</p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Radial_arm_saw_osha.jpg"><img src="/assets/img/ras/Radial_arm_saw_osha.jpg" alt="A radial arm saw" class="img-fluid" /></a></p>

<p><em>Image from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Radial_arm_saw_osha.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></em></p>

<p>I can’t post a picture of what it actually looks like because it’s made of a
material that’s too difficult to photograph under the temperatures and pressures
I can achieve in my garage.</p>

<p>Just kidding. I can’t post a picture of it because it’s in pieces right now.</p>

<p>But I’ll tell you how it works. The long thing at the top is called the “arm”.
You can pull the spinning blade down that arm and through your fingers and also
through the thing you want to cut. That kind of cut would usually be called a
“crosscut”.</p>

<p>Mine runs blades 10” in diameter—a 5” radius. The blade is attached directly
to the motor which takes up some space. So in theory it can cut something up to
~3” thick.</p>

<p>What’s neat about a RAS is how many ways you can turn the blade. You can rotate
it in all three axes. Obviously the blade spins around as it cuts, so that’s one
axis. And you can rotate the motor in the other two axes. So basically you can
put the blade at any angle you want. And the arm goes up and down and can be
rotated, too. It can sort of do the job of two or three other dedicated tools. A
RAS is supposed to be very flexible.</p>

<p>This kind of saw was very popular a few decades ago. Probably because it’s so
versatile and because it takes up so much less space than the two or three other
tools it can sort of replace. That’s why I bought this used one. Since then
they’ve fallen out of favor. They have the reputation of being too dangerous.
But the people who love them and still have all their fingers say they’re not
too dangerous if you keep it dialed in and use it correctly.</p>

<p>My RAS is three decades old. I’m not sure how many decades the manufacturer of
my RAS produced them. It’s not from DeWalt who started making them in the mid
20s (as in the one-hundred-years-ago 20s), but still I guess thirty years old is
pretty young for the design.</p>

<p>But thirty years is plenty of time for there to have been <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2001/CPSC-Emerson-Tool-Co-Announce-Recall-of-Craftsman-Radial-Arm-Saws-Sold-by-Sears-Roebuck-and-Co">a recall</a>
for too many fingers cut off. Which brings me back to why my RAS is in pieces.</p>

<p>One way I plan to help myself keep my fingers is by fine-tuning all its
adjustments. I completely disassembled it, cleaned and degreased the parts that
looked important, and as I put it back together I am adding new grease. I’m also
tightening things that shouldn’t be loose, making sure I don’t over tighten
things that only need to be snug, and sanding down spurs where there shouldn’t
be any.</p>

<p>Now I’m getting to the point where I can start aligning the blade to the table,
to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fence_(woodworking)">fence</a>, and to the
arm. I’ll also align the table to the arm and the arm to the table. Then I’ll
dial it all in with several strategic cuts.</p>

<p>The idea is that a blade that cuts straight, true, smoothly, and precisely will
not only be free of dramatic emergency room visits, but it’ll also make cuts
that look really nice.</p>

<p>Speaking of the strategy and technique for aligning a RAS, I cannot recommend
a book on this subject more highly than Jon Eakes’s
<a href="https://joneakes.com/learning-curve/75-radial-arm-saws">Fine Tuning Your Radial Arm Saw</a>.
His book has been invaluable. It has tons of tips and tricks for getting it set
up simply and effectively, and he walks you through a series of steps with
enough detail to understand why without bogging you down in the minutiae. The
pictures for my brand’s RAS are a little dated (the design must have changed)
but you can still figure out how to apply the principle because he explains why
it works.</p>

<p>I also got some new blades. The blade that came with my purchase could very well
be original to the saw. It wasn’t used heavily, but still it’s not super clean.
Plus it has the wrong angles for crosscutting. Having a nice sharp clean blade
with good angles is supposed to be another way to keep your fingers.</p>

It is
<strong>a domain-specific taxonomy with behavior and semantics</strong>. And “semantics”
means dependencies, an interface, and a name. Inheritance is a kind of an “is a”
relationship, as in “a baby <em>is</em> a person”.</p>

<p>Here is a UML diagram of inheritance:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/inheritance/uml.png" alt="UML diagram of inheritance" class="img-fluid" /></p>

<h2 id="the-good">The good</h2>

<p>When you need a domain-specific taxonomy with behavior and semantics, then there
really is nothing quite as suited to the task as inheritance.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2>

<p>When you use inheritance you get <em>all</em> of that. Even if you’d rather not have it
all.</p>

<p>And can you think of a single time you have <em>needed</em> to glue both semantics and
behavior onto a taxonomy? Was it <em>impossible</em> to accomplish that task without
inheritance?</p>

<p>The only times that come to mind for me are when inheritance was forced on me
by a design that already used and required it. I used to think inheritance was
the best solution to a lot of problems, but looking back I can tell that things
would have been better if done differently.</p>

<h3 id="behavior-vs-semantics">Behavior vs semantics</h3>

<p>Behavior is what the thing does. Semantics is what it looks like (its public
methods and properties).</p>

<p>What if you only want the semantics of a thing but not its behavior?</p>

<p>Here’s an example of using inheritance to get the semantics of a thing when you
don’t care about its behavior:</p>

<p>Notice how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Plane</code> is implemented. It uses <em>none</em> of the behavior of the
underlying <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Car</code> class. The only reason it inherits from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Car</code> is so that it
can operate on a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Taxiway</code> (which is a kind of road)—it needs the
semantics of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Car</code>. But it gets all the baggage of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Car</code> as well.</p>

<h3 id="constructor-parameters-and-other-dependencies">Constructor parameters and other dependencies</h3>

<p>What about constructor parameters?</p>

<p>They’re part of the semantics, too—the constructor is often a
publicly-facing member.</p>

<p>Have you ever added a constructor parameter? Perhaps to refactor and encapsulate
some behavior after you realized it was repeated all over the place?</p>

<p>Inheritance hierarchies tend to get deeper over time. And the deeper it gets,
the harder it is to change constructor parameters.</p>

<p>And sometimes the behavior that uses the constructor parameter is totally
ignored in child classes—what a waste of effort!</p>

<p>Or how about refactoring a base class. Think about the effort that is required
to do that when there are hundreds of derived classes. You have to understand
<em>exactly</em> what your change means in the context of every single one of those
classes. I’ve had to do that multiple times. It’s no fun!</p>

<h3 id="crossing-domain-boundaries">Crossing domain boundaries</h3>

<p>Let’s continue the above example. Planes have to inherit from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Car</code> because they
operate on taxiways (which is a kind of road).</p>

<p>What about float planes?</p>

<p>They can sometimes operate on land, too. See?</p>

<p>From what class should <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FloatPlane</code> inherit?</p>

<p>If it inherits from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Plane</code> then it cannot operate on waterways. And if it
inherits from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Watercraft</code> then it cannot operate on taxiways. And C# won’t let
you inherit from both.</p>

<p>Have you ever found yourself <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=c%23+multiple+inheritance">wishing for multiple inheritance in C#</a>?
I bet you were trying to use inheritance to cross domains.</p>

<h2 id="the-fixes">The fixes</h2>

<p>One fix that would enable you to cross between taxonomies would be to create
adapter classes that inherit from one taxonomy while delegating to an instance
of the other. But that’s just composition in ugly disguise.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my favorite fix: <strong>composition</strong>.</p>

<p>When something is “composed” of other things, that means it has those other
things. Composition is a “has a” relationship. As in “a plane <em>has</em> an engine”.</p>

<p>I favor composition over inheritance. Why relegate composition to only those
times when you need to hack up an inheritance hierarchy?</p>

<h3 id="but-there-are-too-many-classes">“But there are too many classes!”</h3>

<p>Did you notice how many more classes there are now than there were before? There
is basically one class for each behavior and also for each kind of usage of the
behavior.</p>

<p>Actually, you should count them. There aren’t as many more as you might think
(make sure to remember that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Speedboat</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Waterway</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Watercraft</code> don’t have
equivalents in the above composition example).</p>

<p>But even if there were dozens more classes, would that be a bad thing?</p>

<p>The classes will tend to be smaller. They’ll tend to be easier to understand at
a glance. Often, everything you need to know fits on a single screen.</p>

<p>The classes will tend to do less. And just by doing less they will be less prone
to bugs. And smaller <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/HumbleObject.html">humbler</a>
classes tend to be more <em>unit testable</em>.</p>

<p>The classes will tend to change less. If you use composition then you’ll find
that you are either creating or deleting classes more than you are modifying
them. And the fewer the modifications, the fewer the regressions.</p>

<p>The classes will tend to be less affected by change. They cannot be affected by
changes upstream in the inheritance hierarchy, because there is no inheritance
hierarchy. As you tailor classes to specific aspects (and then compose those
aspects instead of using inheritance) then you’ll find that there are fewer
dependencies between classes. And the fewer the dependencies, the lower the
likelihood of a dependency introducing a breaking change.</p>

<p>And with good design these things will remain true as your codebase grows
to arbitrary complexity and thousands of source code files.</p>

<p>Now, you can definitely go overboard with layer upon layer of interfaces and
abstractions—I’m guilty of that!—but that doesn’t <em>necessarily</em>
happen when you favor composition over inheritance. And neither is that
<em>necessarily</em> prevented by using inheritance.</p>

<p>In fact, I have found more than one misuse of inheritance that encouraged
copy-and-paste instead of encapsulation-and-reuse, and that encouraged
needlessly large and deep inheritance hierarchies (read: needlessly many
classes). And I have personally misused inheritance to create needlessly many
layers of abstraction.</p>

<h2 id="the-point">The point</h2>

<p>There is more that could be said, perhaps about how interfaces should be
tailored to the interface’s consumer, or the value of unit testing, or how to
make behavior unit-testable, or how following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID</a>
principles (especially Single Responsibility!) naturally leads to composition
and unit-testability, or the best ways to create an escape hatch from
inheritance without disturbing too much.</p>

<p>But the point is: <strong>Why are you favoring inheritance over composition? Are you misusing inheritance?</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Musings about favoring either inheritance or composition]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Async Method Builders Are Hard</title><link href="/programming/2021/09/30/async-method-builders-are-hard.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Async Method Builders Are Hard" /><published>2021-09-30T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-09-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/programming/2021/09/30/async-method-builders-are-hard</id><content type="html" xml:base="/programming/2021/09/30/async-method-builders-are-hard.html"><![CDATA[<p>C# lets you use asynchronous methods and awaitable expressions.

<p>…and your program will output “Just a second…”, then nothing will happen for
one second, then it’ll output “Ok!”.</p>

<p>Asynchronous methods are marked by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">async</code> keyword. Awaitable expressions
involve the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await</code> keyword.</p>

<p>But what types can an asynchronous method return?</p>

<p>Any awaitable type that has an asynchronous method builder.</p>

<h2 id="builder-type">Builder type</h2>

<p>Microsoft’s documentation on asynchronous method builders pretty much is limited
to this:</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-7.0/task-types">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-7.0/task-types</a></p>

<p>In summary, any type can be returned from an asynchronous method as long as it
is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/expressions#awaitable-expressions">An awaitable type</a></li>
  <li>Decorated with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.compilerservices.asyncmethodbuilderattribute?view=net-5.0"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AsyncMethodBuilder</code></a>
attribute</li>
  <li>And the attribute points to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-7.0/task-types#builder-type">builder type</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="documentation-woes"><del>Documentation woes</del></h2>

<p><del>But Microsoft’s documentation isn’t even correct.</del></p>

<p><del>Of the builder type <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-7.0/task-types#:~:text=awaitunsafeoncompleted()%20should%20call%20awaiter.oncompleted(action)">it says</a>:</del></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><del><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AwaitUnsafeOnCompleted()</code> should call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">awaiter.OnCompleted(action)</code></del></p>
</blockquote>

<p><del>That’s not correct. It should call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">awaiter.UnsafeOnCompleted(action)</code>. That’s
what Microsoft itself <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/v5.0.10/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Runtime/CompilerServices/AsyncTaskMethodBuilderT.cs#L101">does</a>.</del></p>

<p><del>Also, it says:</del></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><del>If the state machine is implemented as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">struct</code>, then
  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">builder.SetStateMachine(stateMachine)</code> is called with a boxed instance of the
  state machine that the builder can cache if necessary.</del></p>
</blockquote>

<p><del>And that’s not correct, either. <a href="https://dotnetfiddle.net/bwBmFj">See?</a> (Make
sure you run that code on your local PC; .NET Fiddle doesn’t run it correctly.)</del></p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/69397857/3063273">Here’s the answer</a>. Guess how
long it took me to figure that one out? I was pondering this <em>for a day or so</em>
before I posted the question on StackOverflow. And then the only way I found out
was by using <a href="https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy">ILSpy</a> on the compiled .dll,
and then only by configuring ILSpy in a specific way.</p>

<p>How are people supposed to know this stuff?</p>

<h3 id="inevitable-heap-allocations">Inevitable heap allocations</h3>

<p>Not long ago I wrote “Async and Await in C# vs Rust”. In that article
<a href="/programming/2021/09/16/async-await-csharp-rust.html#:~:text=async%2Fawait%20system%3A-,C%23%20awaitable%20expressions%20are,something%20on%20the%20heap.,-And%20invoking%20an">I pointed out</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>C# awaitable expressions are composed with callbacks. These callbacks have the
  type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Action</code>, which is a delegate. To package something (e.g. a step in a
  state machine) up into an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Action</code> you have to put something on the heap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, the exact same thing rears its head in async method builders. Async method
builders themselves <em>must</em> create a boxed reference to the async state machine
at some point. Otherwise you run into the above problem.</p>

<p>The StackOverflow answer I linked to above has enough detail to figure out why.
But basically it comes down to the fact that the async state machines are driven
forward by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Action</code> delegates. It’s the other side of the same coin.</p>

<p>Not only is it impossible to compose awaitable expressions without heap
allocations, it’s not even possible to have an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">async</code> method at all without
heap allocations.</p>

<h2 id="the-point">The point</h2>

<p>Microsoft’s implementation of async/await has some flaws. You might not think
they’re very serious, but I think you’ll at least agree that C#’s async method
builders are hard to implement!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A peek under the hood of C#, and a complaint about Microsoft's documentation]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Short Circuit Protection</title><link href="/computers/2021/09/17/short-circuit.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Short Circuit Protection" /><published>2021-09-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-09-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/computers/2021/09/17/short-circuit</id><content type="html" xml:base="/computers/2021/09/17/short-circuit.html"><![CDATA[<p>My PC power supply recently bit the dust. It was during a storm when the power
cut out. My PC wouldn’t turn back on afterward. Maybe a power surge? At any
rate, I ordered a new power supply and it finally arrived yesterday evening.</p>

<p>And I’m happy to report that my new power supply has short circuit protection.
Here’s how I found out.</p>

<hr />

<p>I took the cover off my PC case and freed the old power supply from its screws.
Both the old and the new power supply are modular: instead of all the cables
dangling out of it you only plug in the ones you need. So I unplugged all the
cables from the power supply end. “This will be an easy job” I thought to
myself, “all I have to do is drop the new power supply in and replug all these
modular cables.”</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>First I noticed the main motherboard power connector (the big 24 pin one) was
different. Of course it’s the same on the motherboard end, but on the power
supply the 24 pins are split up into two plugs: something random like 10 pins on
one plug and the remaining 12 pins on another one; two different modular slots
separated by a little distance on the power supply. Did motherboards used to
only take 10 or 12 pin connectors? It was clear that my old plug was not going
to work.</p>

<p>“No problem, I’ll just use the cable that came with the new power supply.”</p>

<p>Next was the auxiliary 8 pin motherboard power plug. Both ends fit.</p>

<p>“Good.”</p>

<p>The graphics card power plug was different on the power supply side. It had the
same number of pins in the same pattern, but they were keyed slightly different.
I don’t really like the new cord. It is flat instead of braided so it doesn’t
sit right in the case. And it has two graphics card plugs on the one end even
though I only have one graphics card. Who wants an extra plug dangling in their
case?</p>

<p><em>Mumble grumble.</em> Out with the old cord, in with the new.</p>

<p>Finally, the two or three strings of hard drive power plugs. Again, exactly the
same on the hard drive side of things, and exactly the same number of pins in
the same pattern on the power supply side. But keyed differently.</p>

<p>“Ugh, why are they doing this to me?”</p>

<p>The other side of the case came off to expose the important ends of my hard
drives. I carefully dissected the kraken’s tangled mess of tentacles. After some
time and effort I had the old power strings in my hand. Next I cautiously
inserted the new strings’ plugs.</p>

<p>“I hope I didn’t accidentally bump any of these SATA connectors.”</p>

<p>And I was done!</p>

<p>On went the case panels, up went my PC onto its little shelf, in went the power
cord and USB plugs and display cords, down went my finger onto the power button.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>“I <em>think</em> I pressed the power button?”</p>

<p>I poked it again. Still nothing.</p>

<p>“Hmm… Maybe the power surge destroyed my motherboard too? Why do I buy such
cheap surge protectors?”</p>

<p>I knew I still had the bent paperclip laying around that I had used to jumper
the old power supply as I diagnosed it. I grabbed that, took the side panel off,
unplugged the motherboard end of the fat 24-pin motherboard power cable, and
carefully inserted the paperclip into the correct two pins.</p>

<p>There was a very faint click from a solenoid in the power supply, then nothing.</p>

<p>I did it again just to see. Same thing. Again. And, there were a couple of faint
clicks, like it was groggily waking up but then something was urgently shouting
at it “Quick!! Save yourself!!” in the midst of other terrified screams and in a
panic it would stumble over itself as it rushed to disconnect itself from the
mains.</p>

<p>Perplexed, I unplugged everything from the power supply.</p>

<p>“Good thing this power supply is modular!”</p>

<p>And I tried again. Just a single click this time.</p>

<p>“That sounds like a normal turning on click to me. Not a panicky click.”</p>

<p>Time for process of elimination. In went the graphics card plug. Fine. The hard
drive plugs. Fine. The big fat 24 pin motherboard plug and the smaller 8 pin aux
power plug.</p>

<p>Not fine.</p>

<p>Actually, there was a very brief flash of light coming from somewhere in the
case.</p>

<p>Now, a flash of light by itself is nothing unusual. They stick LEDs on
everything. I hate them, but the WiFi card has one, some aim out the back of my
motherboard, they’re everywhere. I feel like I had to pay extra to buy RAM
without LEDs. Why would someone want LEDs on their RAM??</p>

<p>“Okay, it doesn’t like my motherboard. But where is that light coming from?”</p>

<p>I kept turning it on. Sometimes there would be two clicks from the power supply.
Sometimes there would be several. The poor power supply was going to have PTSD.
But I had to find that brief flash of light.</p>

<p>And I discovered it wasn’t coming from the open side of the case. It wasn’t
coming from anything in or on the <em>top</em> of the motherboard, but instead I could
see the flash coming from <em>behind</em> the lower corner.</p>

<p>“Oh great, did I drop a screw in there or something?”</p>

<p>I imagined all the things that could have fallen into the holes in the back of
the case.</p>

<p>Out came all the SATA plugs. Out came the graphics card and WiFi card. Out came
the motherboard power plugs. Out came all the screws holding the motherboard in
place. Out came the motherboard.</p>

<p>“Hmm. No loose screws laying around behind the motherboard. Just dust.”</p>

<p>I flipped it around and searched for the scorch marks. Nothing.</p>

<p>Well there had to be something making that light. I looked closer.</p>

<p>And then I saw it: two strings of surface mount LEDs.</p>

<p>On the <em>back</em> of my motherboard.</p>

<p><em>Groan!</em></p>

<p>“I am never buying a single LED ever for the rest of my life. I’m not even going
to talk to anyone who has anything to do with LEDs or anything that LEDs go on,
in, or around. I don’t even like the letter ‘L’ anymore.”</p>

<p>What in the world were they doing on the <em>back</em> of my motherboard?? Diagnostic
lights? Mood lighting? Well all this diagnosing wasn’t putting me in a light
mood.</p>

<p>Okay, it definitely wasn’t arcing. I should have known: the hue wasn’t quite
right, and it was silent. Well at least the light has a legitimate claim to
existence; <em>someone</em> wanted light to come out the back of the motherboard, and
here light was coming out the back. I couldn’t blame the light for doing what it
was designed to do.</p>

<p>In went the motherboard to the case. In went the motherboard screws.</p>

<p>“Hmm. Maybe I’ll do process of elimination again, just to be extra sure.”</p>

<p>In went the 24 pin motherboard plug (and the case power switch plug). I poked
the power button.</p>

<p>And everything sprang to life! I had left the hard drive power cords plugged
into the power supply; they were happily whirring away. My CPU fan was spinning
its little heart out.</p>

<p>Wow! What a wonderful chorus.</p>

<p>“Maybe my graphics card?”</p>

<p>In went the graphics card power. Fine! I could just hear all the money I was
saving by not replacing all these components. What a beautiful noise.</p>

<p>“A short in some case accessory, maybe one of the USB plugs?”</p>

<p>In went all the case accessories and fans. Fine!</p>

<p>I was getting tired of saving money. There was a problem to solve. What in the
world went wrong??</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, what’s this one cord still dangling here?”</p>

<p>I had forgotten about the 8-pin motherboard auxiliary power plug. I guess it
really is auxiliary after all? But it was dangling and begging for a home, so I
plugged it back in.</p>

<p><em>Click.</em></p>

<p>Aha! The culprit, caught red-handed!</p>

<p>I looked closer at that cord and compared it to the new one. Of course the
motherboard side was identical on both. And the power supply side was physically
keyed the same. But there was an empty pin in one place on the one cord, and an
empty pin in a different place on the other cord.</p>

<p>They were wired differently! I was sending 12V straight to ground! A short
circuit!</p>

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/">C#</a> support
asynchronous methods and awaitable expressions.</p>

<p>However, in C# you have to allocate things on the heap and perform dynamic
dispatch when you compose awaitable expressions. Using the heap puts pressure on
the garbage collector which slows things down, and dynamic dispatch is opaque to
the compiler and puts pressure on the JIT engine which slows things down.</p>

<p>Rust doesn’t have these problems. Instead, async/await is a zero-cost
abstraction. It’s even possible to use async/await in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[no_std]</code> (a heapless
environment).</p>

<p>I’m going to explain how async/await works in both languages, then show how the
fact that Rust’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Future</code> trait is polled means Rust doesn’t have to allocate
on the heap or perform dynamic dispatch when you compose awaitable expressions
in Rust. I also hope to clear up a common misunderstanding about the nature of
polling the futures in Rust (no, polling doesn’t make them slow or inefficient).</p>

<p>I think explaining why or how to use async/await is out of the scope of this
article. In fact, if you aren’t totally comfortable using async/await then this
article might not be for you. But if you love it and want to learn a little more
about why Rust’s polled futures are great then keep reading.</p>

<p>It’s surprising, but <em>polled</em> futures are better!</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p><em>Warning: Probably none of the code in this article compiles or works. It was
written off the cuff and should only be taken for inspiration.</em></p>

<p>First, let’s take a look at some example async code in both languages.</p>

<p>In C# you can do this:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">using</span> <span class="nn">System</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">using</span> <span class="nn">System.Threading.Tasks</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">Main</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">task</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nf">RunAsync</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// Immediately prints "Just a second..."</span>
        <span class="n">task</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">GetAwaiter</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nf">GetResult</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// Blocks as it delays for one second then prints "Ok!"</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">async</span> <span class="n">Task</span> <span class="nf">RunAsync</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Just a second..."</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="k">await</span> <span class="n">Task</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Delay</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">TimeSpan</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">FromSeconds</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">));</span>
        <span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Ok!"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And in Rust you can write this:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">use</span> <span class="nn">async_std</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">task</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">use</span> <span class="nn">futures</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nn">executor</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">block_on</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">async</span> <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">run</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nd">println!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Just a second..."</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="nn">task</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">sleep</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nn">Duration</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">from_secs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="k">.await</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nd">println!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Ok!"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">future</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">run</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// Doesn't print anything</span>
    <span class="nf">block_on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">future</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// Blocks as it prints "Just a second...", delays for one second, and then prints "Ok!"</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both programs will output “Just a second…”, then nothing will happen for one
second, then they’ll both output “Ok!”.</p>

<p>The <strong>asynchronous methods</strong> in both languages are marked by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">async</code>
keyword:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">async</span> <span class="n">Task</span> <span class="nf">RunAsync</span><span class="p">()</span>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   <span class="k">async</span> <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">run</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="c1">// ^^^^^</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the <strong>awaitable expressions</strong> in both languages involve the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await</code> keyword:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   <span class="k">await</span> <span class="n">Task</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Delay</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">TimeSpan</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">FromSeconds</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="c1">//       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expression</span>
<span class="c1">// ^^^^^ keyword</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   <span class="nn">task</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">sleep</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nn">Duration</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">from_secs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="k">.await</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//                                     ^^^^^^ keyword</span>
<span class="c1">// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expression</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Functionally, C#’s tasks are pretty similar to Rust’s futures. They’re both
pretty ergonomic, and they both bring all the benefits of async/await code.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that one difference is that a C# task automatically starts as soon
as you create it, and it runs itself, but a future in Rust is inert and has to
be ushered along by something else.</p>

<p>Rust’s futures have to be polled.</p>

<p><em>What?!</em> Yes you heard right. <em>Polled</em>.</p>

<p>But that’s a good thing. To understand why, we need to do a deep dive into C#.</p>

<h2 id="deep-divec">Deep dive—C#</h2>

<p>Let’s turn our attention to C#. I’ll explain how things work in C# and then show
why heap allocations and dynamic dispatch are inevitable.</p>

<h3 id="how-the-await-keyword-works">How the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await</code> keyword works</h3>

<p>C#’s compiler automatically transforms <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">async</code> methods into a state machine. And
within an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">async</code> method you can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await</code>
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/expressions#awaitable-expressions">awaitable expressions</a>.</p>

<p>For example, when you execute this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RunAsync()</code> method:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">async</span> <span class="n">Task</span> <span class="nf">RunAsync</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Running!"</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="k">value</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">await</span> <span class="nf">GetValueAsync</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">value</span> <span class="p">%</span> <span class="m">2</span> <span class="p">==</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">await</span> <span class="nf">DoEvenThingAsync</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">else</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">object</span> <span class="n">oddResult</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">await</span> <span class="nf">DoOddThingAsync</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">oddResult</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">ToString</span><span class="p">());</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>…then you’re actually executing something like this monstrosity that the
compiler automatically generated for you:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">Task</span> <span class="nf">RunAsync</span><span class="p">()</span>

<p>Of course the above is just inspirational pseudocode. But can you trace through
it and see how it works?</p>

<p>Please don’t get lost. What I want you to see is if you want to get a value out
of a C#
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/expressions#awaitable-expressions">awaitable expression</a>,
you have to do something like this:</p>

<p>…and the compiler automatically does that for you with a state machine when
you use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await</code> keyword in an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">async</code> context.</p>

<h4 id="weeds">Weeds</h4>

<p>If you want to learn how to tell C# to build the async state machine in a
specific way then take a look at C#’s
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-7.0/task-types">task type documentation</a>.</p>

<p>If you look at how the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Task&lt;T&gt;</code> class’s state machine
<a href="https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/runtime/compilerservices/AsyncMethodBuilder.cs,5916df9e324fc0a1">is constructed</a>
then you’ll see that it’s a bit different than my above pseudocode. Among other
things, it captures the current <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SynchronizationContext</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ExecutionContext</code>
so that continuations can be executed on them.</p>

<p>The fact that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SynchronizationContext</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ExecutionContext</code> are <em>static</em> state
in C# was significant to the Rust language team when they decided how to design
their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Future</code> trait. Rustaceans don’t like static state. Initial
implementations of futures in Rust relied on thread local storage, but that was
a dead end because thread local storage isn’t available in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[no_std]</code> Rust code.</p>

<p>Okay let’s quit wandering around in these weeds and see if we can make some more
progress.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-create-your-own-awaitable-expressions">How to create your own awaitable expressions</h3>

<p>You don’t have to rely only on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Task</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask</code>, or any of the other
framework-provided awaitable types. You can create your own
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/expressions#awaitable-expressions">awaitable type</a>.</p>

<p>Basically it comes down to implementing this interface on a thing:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">using</span> <span class="nn">System.Runtime.CompilerServices</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">interface</span> <span class="nc">IAwaiter</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">out</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">INotifyCompletion</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">IsCompleted</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">get</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="n">T</span> <span class="nf">GetResult</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>…then returning that thing from your awaitable type’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GetAwaiter()</code> method.</p>

<p>That interface doesn’t exist in the .Net framework. You can create it if you
want, but any type that has that signature—implement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INotifyCompletion</code>,
have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bool IsCompleted</code> property, have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T GetResult()</code> method—will
work as an awaiter. And any type that returns an awaiter from a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GetAwaiter()</code>
method can be awaited.</p>

<p>Like this:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyAwaitable</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Recall from the previous section how the compiler will create a state machine
that essentially does this with your awaitable type:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Almost the same as the RunAsync method above:</span>

  <span class="nf">handleTheResult</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">result</span><span class="p">);</span>

  <span class="c1">// .GetResult() won't immediately return because the task isn't yet complete</span>

  <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You should now understand how you need to implement your awaitable type. The
awaiter type returned from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GetAwaiter()</code> needs to do these things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IsCompleted</code> when the asynchronous work is completed</li>
  <li>Accept a continuation/callback passed to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OnCompleted</code> method. This
callback should be executed when the asynchronous work is completed. Keep in
mind a callback won’t be passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OnCompleted</code> if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IsCompleted</code> returned
true when it was checked</li>
  <li>Synchronously return the result or throw an exception from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GetResult</code>
method. Some implementations will choose to make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GetResult</code> synchronously
block if the asynchronous work isn’t yet complete</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/expressions#awaitable-expressions">The documentation</a>
explains how to create an awaitable type that returns nothing/void. Basically,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GetResult</code> should return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">void</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code>. If only C# would let us use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">void</code> as a generic type parameter!</p>

<h3 id="how-to-compose-awaitable-expressions">How to compose awaitable expressions</h3>

<p>So how do you compose (as in combine) awaitable expressions? You now have
everything you need to answer this question.</p>

<p>As I showed in the “How the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await</code> keyword works” section above, the C#
compiler transforms code like this:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">async</span> <span class="n">Task</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">FooAsync</span><span class="p">()</span>

  <span class="c1">// await keyword</span>
  <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">await</span> <span class="nf">GetCAsync</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">);</span>

  <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">d</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nf">GetD</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">e</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nf">GetE</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">d</span><span class="p">);</span>

  <span class="c1">// await keyword</span>
  <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">await</span> <span class="nf">GetFAsync</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="p">);</span>

  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>…into a state machine.</p>

<p>The state machine has one step for each synchronous code block. The steps are
wrapped up as continuations/callbacks which get passed to the various awaiters
along the way. The awaiters decide when to execute the callbacks.</p>

<p>You can do the same thing by hand if you wish.</p>

<p>So the answer is: in C#, awaitable expressions are composed <em>with callbacks</em>.</p>

<h3 id="why-heap-allocations-and-dynamic-dispatch-are-inevitable-when-you-compose-awaitable-expressions">Why heap allocations and dynamic dispatch are inevitable when you compose awaitable expressions</h3>

<p>You should now see why heap allocations and dynamic dispatch are inevitable in
C#’s async/await system: C# awaitable expressions are composed with callbacks.
These callbacks have the type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Action</code>, which is a delegate.</p>

<p>To package something (e.g. a step in a state machine) up into an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Action</code> you
have to put something on the heap.</p>

<p>And invoking an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Action</code> is dynamic dispatch.</p>

<h4 id="but-what-about-valuetask">But what about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask</code>?</h4>

<p>I can just hear it now. You’re wondering if this applies to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask</code>. After
all, Microsoft created <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask</code> expressly
<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/understanding-the-whys-whats-and-whens-of-valuetask/#:~:text=nothing%20need%20be%20allocated%3A%20we%20can%20simply%20initialize%20this%20valuetask%3Ctresult%3E%20struct%20with%20the%20tresult%20and%20return%20that">so that</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>nothing need be allocated [in certain cases]: we can simply initialize this
  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask&lt;TResult&gt;</code> struct with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TResult</code> and return that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But keep reading. That only applies to the <em>synchronous</em> case, when the result
of an asynchronous method is already known and can be returned synchronously.</p>

<p>In other words, when the awaiter’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IsCompleted</code> property returns true then its
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GetResult</code> method is immediately/synchronously invoked and the result is
immediately available. There’s no need to instantiate an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Action</code> to pass to its
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OnCompleted</code> method.</p>

<p>But when the result isn’t available synchronously: heap allocation and dynamic
dispatch.</p>

<p>Now, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask</code> has a trick up its sleeve. You can create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask</code> from an
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.sources.ivaluetasksource?view=net-5.0"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IValueTaskSource</code></a>.
That does help minimize heap allocations in certain cases, but it’s kind of
complicated to implement that interface. And I think that implementations
necessarily come with compromises.</p>

<p>For example: when you create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask</code> with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IValueTaskSource</code> then you
create it
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.valuetask.-ctor?view=net-5.0#System_Threading_Tasks_ValueTask__ctor_System_Threading_Tasks_Sources_IValueTaskSource_System_Int16_">with a token</a>.
And that token is only a 16-bit integer. You can only have so many <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask</code>s
in play at once for a given <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IValueTaskSource</code>. And how do you know when a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask</code> should be taken out of play and its token recycled? If I have a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask</code> then what’s to keep me from continuing to call
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">valueTask.GetAwaiter().GetResult()</code> on it over and over? There is nothing built
into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IValueTaskSource</code> to let you know when the token can be
recycled. You can only recycle the tokens if you have full control over the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask</code>s that are created with your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IValueTaskSource</code>. That limits the
usefulness of this trick.</p>

<p><strong>Edit September 29, 2021:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.valuetask-1?view=net-5.0#remarks">The documentation for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask</code></a>
  says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask&lt;TResult&gt;</code> instance may only be awaited once, and consumers may
    not read <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Result</code> until the instance has completed. If these limitations are
    unacceptable, convert the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask&lt;TResult&gt;</code> to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Task&lt;TResult&gt;</code> by
    calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AsTask</code>.</p>

    <p>The following operations should never be performed on a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask&lt;TResult&gt;</code>
    instance:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Awaiting the instance multiple times.</li>
      <li>Calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AsTask</code> multiple times.</li>
      <li>Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.Result</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.GetAwaiter().GetResult()</code> when the operation hasn’t
    yet completed, or using them multiple times.</li>
      <li>Using more than one of these techniques to consume the instance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you do any of the above, the results are undefined.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Now, I’m pretty sure these limitations do not apply if you create a
  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask</code>
  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.valuetask-1.-ctor?view=net-5.0#System_Threading_Tasks_ValueTask_1__ctor_System_Threading_Tasks_Task__0__">from a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Task</code></a>.
  But do you see how even <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask</code> has specific limitations?</p>

  <p>These limitations necessarily exist because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask</code> is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">struct</code> (meaning
  you use value semantics on it and instances probably live on the stack). It’s
  very easy to create copies of C# <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">struct</code>s—just assign the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">struct</code> to
  another variable—but changing the state of one does not change the state
  of the copies. In C# there <em>must</em> be an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Action</code> continuation object, and a
  reference to it <em>must</em> to be kept somewhere. Perhaps the ideal design would
  only let there be a single reference so that once the continuation is executed
  then that single reference can be discarded (which would be the signal that
  the asynchronous operation has completed). But it’s impossible to do that in
  C# with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">struct</code>s because of how easy it is to copy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">struct</code>s and because of
  how disconnected they are once you do; the developer must either have full
  control of all instances of the struct, or else he must document a contract
  (like Microsoft has done for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask</code> above) and hope that people stick to
  it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And again, at the end of the day, even with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueTask</code> and all its tricks, if
the awaiter returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code> from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IsCompleted</code> then there is going to be at
least one heap allocation and dynamic dispatch.</p>

<p>This is why the Rust language devs
<a href="http://aturon.github.io/tech/2016/09/07/futures-design/#:~:text=we%20were%20unable%20to%20make%20the%20%E2%80%9Cstandard%E2%80%9D%20future%20abstraction%20provide%20zero-cost%20composition%20of%20futures%2C%20and%20we%20know%20of%20no%20%E2%80%9Cstandard%E2%80%9D%20implementation%20that%20does%20so.">say</a>:</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="shallow-diverust">Shallow dive—Rust</h2>

<p>Let’s turn our attention to Rust.</p>

<p>I’m less familiar with Rust so I won’t be able to provide as much detail. But I
think you’ll still see why Rust futures are better.</p>

<h3 id="how-the-await-keyword-works-1">How the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await</code> keyword works</h3>

<p>Actually I don’t entirely know how the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await</code> keyword works in Rust. I’m only
able to find documentation on <em>what</em> it does.</p>

<p>My best guess is the Rust compiler generates a state machine similar to how the
C# compiler does it.</p>

<p>But keep in mind that in Rust, closures are strongly typed, can be statically
dispatched, and can live on the stack. So if async blocks are broken up into
various steps in a state machine, that state machine and all its steps will be
transparent to the compiler. And its steps can be statically dispatched without
heap allocations.</p>

<p>However it works, the Rust language devs are clear that async/await is a
zero-cost abstraction. So dynamic dispatch and heap allocation are definitely
<em>not</em> necessary.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-create-your-own-awaitable-expressions-1">How to create your own awaitable expressions</h3>

you by the async/await system.</p>

<p>And there are no heap allocations in polling this future. Even when it’s not yet
ready nothing needs to be placed on the heap. Sure there is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clone()</code> call in
there, but that places something into memory that has already been reserved
within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OneShotTimer</code>. This <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OneShotTimer</code> might happily live on the stack
and you could call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">poll()</code> in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[no_std]</code> environment.</p>

<h4 id="a-quick-note-about-what-polling-is-not">A quick note about what polling is not</h4>

<p>You don’t have to always continually poll every single future. Rust’s futures
tell you when they’re ready to be polled again. And you know which one told you
because either you or your task executor gave it a specific <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Waker</code>, and you
did remember to create that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Waker</code> in a way that associates it with the
currently executing task, right? So you don’t have to poll <em>all</em> the futures.</p>

<p>Here is what
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/future/trait.Future.html#runtime-characteristics">the documentation</a>
says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">poll</code> function is not called repeatedly in a tight loop – instead, it
  should only be called when the future indicates that it is ready to make
  progress (by calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wake()</code>). If you’re familiar with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">poll(2)</code> or
  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">select(2)</code> syscalls on Unix it’s worth noting that futures typically do <em>not</em>
  suffer the same problems of “all wakeups must poll all events”; they are more
  like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">epoll(4)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe there’s a more idiomatic way, I dunno. But do you see any heap allocations
anywhere in this composition of two futures?</p>

<p>Do you see how instead of being composed with callbacks and dynamic dispatch,
Rust futures are composed <em>with static dispatch</em>?</p>

<h3 id="why-heap-allocations-and-dynamic-dispatch-are-avoidable-when-you-compose-futures">Why heap allocations and dynamic dispatch are avoidable when you compose futures</h3>

<p>It’s redundant to say this again, but the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Future::poll()</code> method does not
require heap allocation or dynamic dispatch. Instead it can be statically
dispatched on things on the stack.</p>

<h2 id="can-asyncawait-in-c-be-like-rust">Can async/await in C# be like Rust?</h2>

<p>What’s to keep you from implementing your own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IFuture</code> interface in C# and
making your own async/await framework?</p>

<p>Almost nothing. Here’s an attempt in C# that I think would get most of the way
there. But Rust’s ownership and lifetime system is really excellent, and I think
this example suffers without it:</p>

<p>There are neither heap allocations nor dynamic dispatch anywhere in sight.</p>

<p>You would have to be very careful with ownership and lifetimes of these structs,
though. I’m sure havoc would ensue the moment you clone a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Joined</code> struct and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Poll()</code>‘ed both instances.</p>

<p>But if you walked <em>very</em> carefully then I’m sure it could work.</p>

<h2 id="the-point">The point</h2>

<p>You can compose Rust futures without heap allocations or dynamic dispatch.
That’s not true of C#’s tasks (or any other possible awaitable type).</p>

<p>Rust’s heapless composition power comes from the fact that Rust’s futures are
polled. Because they are polled they can be composed with static dispatch
instead of callbacks.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is his motivation?</li>
  <li>What was the outcome?</li>
  <li>What scriptural basis does he have?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="his-motivation">His motivation</h2>

<p>On his page which <a href="https://www.joshhunt.com/articles.htm">lists his articles</a>,
this one appears with the heading “How to Introduce a Contemporary Service in a
Traditional Church and Double Your Attendance”.</p>

<p>Within the article itself he says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had this feeling in my gut that contemporary music would make a big
  difference in reaching the post World War II crowd.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I grew up on the mission field and knew that to reach people, you have to eat
  their food, dress their dress, and <em>play their music</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Was there a way we could harness the power of contemporary music for the use
  of the kingdom and do it in the traditional church God had called us to?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s clear that his motivation is growth in numbers through “reaching” a
different demographic.</p>

<h2 id="the-outcome-in-his-own-words">The outcome in his own words</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>We searched for a way to make these two odd bedfellows coexist. Was there a
  way we could harness the power of contemporary music for the use of the
  kingdom and do it in the traditional church God had called us to? And really,
  we wanted more than coexistence. We wanted both groups to appreciate the other
  out of a spirit of Christian unity. Were these pipe dreams? Had all our
  learning driven us mad?</p>

  <p>Five years later, we tentatively suggest that this wedding is possible. This
  is the true story of the successes and failures of trying to introduce
  contemporary worship into a forty year old, traditional Baptist church.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Josh Hunt says that after five years, these things have happened:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They harnessed “the power of contemporary music for the use of the kingdom”</li>
  <li>They did that within a formerly-traditional church</li>
  <li>There is Christian unity between the traditional and the contemporary groups</li>
</ul>

<p>What does he mean by these things?</p>

<h3 id="the-power-of-contemporary-music">The power of contemporary music</h3>

<p>It’s not immediately clear what he means by this. Presumably he means the
<em>attractive</em> power of contemporary music. It draws people who like it.</p>

<p>I bet it was the same in the late 90s as it is now: younger people like
contemporary music and tend to be happy to migrate to a contemporary church that
suites their taste.</p>

<p>I find support for this when he says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a limit to how far you can stretch this service and still appeal to
  traditional people.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contemporary attracts contemporary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I think he means they have harnessed the power of contemporary music to
attract a younger crowd.</p>

<p>As you read his article you can get a feel for some of the prices they have paid
(and continue to pay). And I interact with some of those things below. But it’s
clear that Josh attributes the growth in numbers directly to their change in
music style. They added a different music style, and that brought in a different
generation.</p>

<h3 id="within-a-formerly-traditional-church">Within a <em>formerly</em>-traditional church</h3>

<p>Josh uses the present tense when he calls his church “traditional”. However,
it’s clear from what he has written that it was no longer traditional at the
time of his writing.</p>

<p>First, Josh views contemporary and traditional worship as mutually exclusive.
True, he has a whole paragraph on how to blend aspects of both. But then he
says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lesson # 3: <strong>don’t try to mix formats</strong>. If you prefer one style over the
  other, there is always a tendency to want to keep the some movement of one
  toward the other. We have learned the hard way to <strong>avoid this tendency</strong>.
  <strong>Once two formats are established, people know what they want, the come to
  the service they want, and they don’t like surprises</strong>.</p>

  <p>This is the beauty of the multi-congregational approach. We don’t have to get
  people to change their worship in order to reach people who want more
  contemporary worship. All we have to do is get them to grant permission for
  another type of worship to exist. Our people will do this <strong>as long as we
  don’t gradually introduce more and more contemporary elements into traditional
  services</strong>.</p>

  <p>We can do this because we do not believe that one format is inherently better
  than the other. God does not prefer contemporary worship over traditional.
  They both have strategic value. Many of my neighbors, who are mostly retired
  couples, <strong>will not be reached through contemporary music. They want their
  church to sound like church. We want to have a high quality traditional
  worship because we believe it is pleasing to God and strategically valuable in
  ministering to our community. With this conviction firmly in place, it frees
  us from the temptation of allowing a service’s format to drift. Of course, not
  to worry. If it drifts much, people will let you know</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you see how traditional and contemporary worship are mutually exclusive, even
within Josh’s success story?</p>

<p>Later he says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Be careful about what you do with special, all-church events. If you say with
  your lips that choirs are just as good as vocal bands but you invite the vocal
  band to sing for Easter and Christmas every year, you are sending two
  messages. We have had to be very careful that these major inter-congregational
  events are handled in an even-handed way. People are watching to see what kind
  of invitations their group gets, and what kinds the other guys get. Actions
  speak louder than words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you see how careful Josh says they have to be when these two groups interact?</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a nagging feeling that the difference between a contemporary mind set
  and a traditional mind set goes deeper than music. As stated earlier, part of
  me wonders if this won’t end up being <strong>a ten year birthing process of a new
  church. People who like contemporary music tend to have different opinions on
  a wide variety of things</strong>, such as denominational loyalty, church government,
  how money is spent, and ethical issues such as drinking in moderation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you catch how he dressed up the phrase “slow church split”?</p>

<p>In Josh’s words they have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two mutually exclusive worship services</li>
  <li>Two distinctly different groups of people</li>
  <li>Tension anytime these two groups interact</li>
  <li>On a trajectory to split</li>
</ul>

<p>What do you call one organization with these attributes? Traditional?
Contemporary? To me it sounds a lot like one traditional church and one
contemporary church meeting in the same building at different times and
sometimes doing things together, and at some point in the future they very well
might decide to part ways.</p>

<p>Whatever you call that organization, it’s certainly no longer what it was.</p>

<h3 id="christian-unity-between-the-traditional-and-the-contemporary-groups">Christian unity between the traditional and the contemporary groups</h3>

<p>Josh has a strange way of defining “Christian unity”. Again, in Josh’s words
they have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two mutually exclusive worship services</li>
  <li>Two distinctly different groups of people</li>
  <li>Tension anytime these two groups interact</li>
  <li>On a trajectory to split</li>
</ul>

<p>His article is also full of examples of conflict being resolved by acquiescence
(the pulpit placement), people being repelled to the other service/group (the
piano player who didn’t really like contemporary music), unresolved issues, and
effectively a church split in the making (however amicable it has been).</p>

<p>What kind of unity is that? I think Josh’s definition of “Christian unity” is
“uneasy ceasefire”. Strange.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-this-church-like-in-2021">What is this church like in 2021?</h2>

<p>You have to do a bit of sleuthing to find out which church Josh Hunt was talking
about. I <em>think</em> I found it. On <a href="https://www.joshhunt.com/bio.htm">his bio</a> he
says that he served as Minister of Education at Calvary Baptist Church, Las
Cruces, New Mexico.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During the eleven years he served this church, they went from one service and
  one Sunday School to four services and four Sunday Schools. Overall attendance
  nearly tripled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://cbclascruces.org/about/constitution">Calvary Baptist’s constitution</a>
says they were incorporated on July 21, 1951. In 1997 (apparently when Josh
wrote this article) the church would have been 46 years old. And recall he wrote
it to summarize the previous five years of “trying to introduce contemporary
worship into a forty year old, traditional Baptist church”. 46 minus 5 = 41,
close enough to “forty years old”.</p>

<p>It’s difficult to discern the character of a church from a distance. Not to
mention it’s easy to be condemning so it’s kind of risky. But let’s assume this
is the church he was talking about. If so, then a few things are definitely
true:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The church is still around</li>
  <li>It <a href="https://cbclascruces.org/about/service-times">has two services</a>. That
aligns with what Josh said in his article (although it is different than four
services like his bio says—but keep in mind quite a bit of time has
passed since Josh Hunt was there, and also COVID is a thing)</li>
  <li><a href="https://cbclascruces.org/ministries/worship-arts">Evidently</a> it still uses
contemporary music</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="they-only-got-one-shot">They only got one shot</h3>

<p>In Josh’s words, his church more than doubled in numbers by embracing
contemporary music. That happened with Calvary Baptist, but it didn’t happen
again—they’re still two-service, not eight-service or sixteen-service. And
they didn’t go back to traditional music. So Josh’s advice for them was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Single use only. Once you’ve embraced contemporary music then that’s it. It’s
not like you can embrace it <em>again</em> because you’ve already used that trick
and are there. It’s not a goose that lays golden eggs</li>
  <li>A one-way street. Josh details no plan for going back to traditional worship
if the church wanted it, and after 24 years the church Josh was talking about
hasn’t gone back</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="whats-next-for-churches-like-this">What’s next for churches like this?</h3>

<p>I want to focus on the first point. How would this church double in numbers
again? What tricks or untapped resources remain for it? If doubling your numbers
is why you (like Josh Hunt) are embracing contemporary music, then what are you
going to do once you’re there?</p>

<p>Will you find ways to become content with your size (isn’t that self defeating)?
Will you decide it’s more important to focus on growing your congregation in
<em>depth</em> (so you’re telling me the numbers aren’t important after all)? Will you
find more groups to “reach” and continue tacking on more services to suit all
these different groups? Will you be too bogged down by internal strife generated
by the transition (was it worth it)?</p>

<p>Surely God has given his church a better growth plan than this.</p>

<h2 id="where-is-the-bible">Where is the Bible?</h2>

<p>I don’t see a single Bible verse. Instead, Josh’s article is full of appeals
to… well, read it for yourself. Here’s how he concludes his article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the positive side, let me be clear I am positively enthusiastic about our
  journey into contemporary worship. <strong>It has allowed us to use our resources
  more efficiently</strong>. Contemporary worship is not the only way we could have
  five weekend services, but it is one way.</p>

  <p><strong>It has allowed us to reach people faster than ever before</strong>. We filled a 250
  seat auditorium in 18 months using contemporary worship. And, we have
  <strong>reached into a different segment of the population</strong>. Contemporary worship
  not only reaches people, it reaches people we probably could not reach with a
  traditional worship service alone. Much of this has to do with music. We hope
  in time to have additional worship formats–country music perhaps.</p>

  <p>I think the <strong>contemporary worship helps the people it reaches to worship
  better</strong> than they would in a traditional worship. It is true of me. I worship
  better with contemporary music than I do with traditional music because I am
  not fighting against my own tastes.</p>

  <p><strong>I just like contemporary worship</strong>. I think church leaders need better
  reasons than personal taste to do something. However, I think it would be very
  difficult to start a contemporary service unless the leadership did enjoy it.
  It would be impossible for me to help with a country service. Philosophically,
  I would have no problem, as long as they didn’t ask me to come or pay for the
  steel guitars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To summarize, Josh says contemporary music:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is more efficient</li>
  <li>Has wider, quicker reach</li>
  <li>Frees people’s worship</li>
  <li>Suits his personal taste</li>
</ul>

<p>But again, where is the Bible in any of this?</p>

<p>Does the Bible have anything to say about how important a church’s <em>efficiency</em>
is, or whether it’s more important to be <em>effective</em>, or what it even means to
be efficient or effective in “kingdom” work?</p>

<p>Does the Bible have anything to say about how to “reach” people, what “reaching”
them even means, and whether the weekly gathering of God’s people should be for
evangelism or for mutual encouragement of people who are already saved?</p>

<p>Does the Bible have anything to say about whether people’s personal tastes in
worship are good and need to be “freed” or if there are any dangers and they
need to be changed?</p>

<p>Does the Bible have anything to say about what Christian unity is?</p>

<p>There is not a single Bible verse referenced in his entire article. Would Josh
be able to use scripture to back up his claims about efficiency, effectiveness,
freedom, and worship? Or does he only have subjective pragmatism on his side?</p>

<h2 id="the-point">The point</h2>

<p>If you want to tack on another service and fill your auditorium by attracting
more people, then maybe Josh’s advice is for you. Just keep in mind it might
come at the cost he outlined:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alienated members</li>
  <li>Uneasy ceasefires</li>
  <li>Disunity</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you want this for your church?</p>

<p>I also suspect there’s a lesson to be learned here about come-and-see
philosophies of evangelism. Maybe I’ll explore that later.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="christian" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A critique of Josh Hunt's article]]></summary></entry></feed>
