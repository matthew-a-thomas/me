Every year we celebrate Christmas. But what is so much more special about Jesus
that we celebrate _His_ birthday instead of anyone else?

To quote the song,

> This, this is Christ the King

But He isn't just any king. He is...

## The promised Son of David

Here's {% include verse.html verse="2 Samuel 7:4&ndash;17" %}:

> But that same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan, “Go and tell my
  servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD: Would you build me a house to dwell in? I
  have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the people of Israel from
  Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about in a tent for my dwelling. In
  all places where I have moved with all the people of Israel, did I speak a
  word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people
  Israel, saying, “Why have you not built me a house of cedar?”’ Now, therefore,
  thus you shall say to my servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, I took
  you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over
  my people Israel. And I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off
  all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a great name, like
  the name of the great ones of the earth. And I will appoint a place for my
  people Israel and will plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place
  and be disturbed no more. And violent men shall afflict them no more, as
  formerly, from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I
  will give you rest from all your enemies. **Moreover, the LORD declares to you
  that the LORD will make you a house. When your days are fulfilled and you lie
  down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall
  come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house
  for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. _I will
  be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son_. When he commits iniquity, I
  will discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men,
  but my steadfast love will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I
  put away from before you. And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure
  forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.**’” In accordance
  with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to
  David.

God promised that there would be a man to sit on David's throne _forever_.

Did you catch how God said this man would "be to me a son"? That's where the
title "Son of God" comes from. Which means Jesus is also...

## The Son of God

Here's {% include verse.html verse="Psalm 2:7&ndash;12" %}:

> I will tell of the decree:
	The LORD said to me, “**You are my Son**; today I have begotten you. Ask of me,
  and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your
  possession. You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces
  like a potter’s vessel.” Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers
  of the earth. Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss **the
  Son**, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly
  kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.

Do you see the strong connection between rulership and the title "Son of God"?

That's all behind the voice that came from heaven during Jesus's baptism in
{% include verse.html verse="Matthew 3:13&ndash;17" %}:

> Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
  John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do
  you come to me?” But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now, for thus it is
  fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he consented. And when
  Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the
  heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a
  dove and coming to rest on him; and behold, **a voice from heaven said, “This
  is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”**

Not only is Jesus the Son of God, He is also...

## The Son of Man

Remember {% include verse.html verse="Daniel 7:13&ndash;14" %}?

> “I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came
  one like **a son of man**, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was
  presented before him. And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom,
  that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an
  everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that
  shall not be destroyed.

This title also has strong connections to rulership and authority.

Jesus loved to apply this title to himself. Recall
{% include verse.html verse="Mark 14:61&ndash;62" %}:

> The high priest asked Jesus, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?” And
  Jesus said, “I am, and you will see **the Son of Man** seated at the right
  hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.”

## The promised offspring of Adam and Eve

Here's {% include verse.html verse="Genesis 3:14&ndash;15" %}:

> The LORD God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, cursed are you
  above all livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall
  go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life. **I will put enmity
  between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he
  shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.**”

Jesus bruised the head of Satan by utterly defeating him, like
{% include verse.html verse="Hebrews 2:14&ndash;15" %} says:

> Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise
  partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who
  has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through
  fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.

In other words Jesus isn't just a king. He is also a redeemer. Which means He
purchases something. But He isn't just any redeemer, He is the one God promised
would deliver Adam and Eve's children from their sin.

This isn't the only time God promised such a one. Jesus is also...

## The promised offspring of Abraham

{% include verse.html verse="Genesis 12:1&ndash;3" %} is talking about Jesus
when it says:

> Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your
  father’s house to the land that I will show you. And I will make of you a
  great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will
  be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I
  will curse, and **in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.**”

That's talking about an offspring of Abraham by whom the nations would be
blessed. This is what Paul meant when he wrote
{% include verse.html verse="Galatians 3:7&ndash;9" %} and
{% include verse.html verse="Galatians 3:16" %}:

> Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. And the
  Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached
  the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be
  blessed.” So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the
  man of faith.

> Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say,
  “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your
  offspring,” who is Christ.

This blessing on the nations came through Jesus's bloody death, which also makes
Him...

## The Lamb of God

Remember Abraham and Isaac, how Abraham told Isaac that God would provide the
sacrificial lamb? That was pointing forward to Jesus.

Remember Passover? The blood of a lamb marked the doorposts of people whom God
passed over in His judgment. That was pointing forward to Jesus.

This is why John the Baptist said (in
{% include verse.html verse="John 1:29" %}):

> The next day [John] saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb
  of God, who takes away the sin of the world!

This is what Peter meant in
{% include verse.html verse="1 Peter 1:18&ndash;19" %}:

> You were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not
  with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of
  Christ, **like that of a lamb without blemish or spot**.

This is what John saw in {% include verse.html verse="Revelation 5" %}:

> Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll
  written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals. And I saw a mighty
  angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and
  break its seals?” And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able
  to open the scroll or to look into it, and I began to weep loudly because no
  one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it. And one of the
  elders said to me, “Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the
  Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven
  seals.” And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the
  elders I saw **a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain**, with seven
  horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into
  all the earth. And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who
  was seated on the throne. And when he had taken the scroll, the four living
  creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a
  harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
  And they sang a new song, saying, “Worthy are you to take the scroll and to
  open its seals, for you were slain, and **by your blood you ransomed people**
  for God	from every tribe and language and people and nation, and you have made
  them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they shall reign on the earth.”
  Then I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the
  elders the voice of many angels, numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of
  thousands, saying with a loud voice, “**Worthy is the Lamb who was slain**, to
  receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and
  blessing!” And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the
  earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, saying, “To him who sits on the
  throne **and to the Lamb** be blessing and honor and glory and might forever
  and ever!” And the four living creatures said, “Amen!” and the elders fell
  down and worshiped.

And it isn't idolatrous to worship Jesus because He is...

## God incarnate

{% include verse.html verse="John 1:1&ndash;3" %} and
{% include verse.html verse="John 1:14&ndash;18" %} say:

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
  God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and
  without him was not any thing made that was made.

> And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory,
  glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John bore
  witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes
  after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”) For from his fullness
  we have all received, grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses;
  grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; the only
  God, who is at the Father’s side, he has made him known.

## The point

Jesus is he of whom it was said in
{% include verse.html verse="Isaiah 9:6&ndash;7" %}:

> For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be
  upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty
  God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government
  and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his
  kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness
  from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do
  this.
