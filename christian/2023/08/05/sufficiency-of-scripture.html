          <p>Matthew Barrett <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/essay/the-sufficiency-of-scripture/">wrote an essay on TGC</a> titled
“The Sufficiency of Scripture”.</p>

<h2 id="summary-of-the-article">Summary of the article</h2>

<p>Here is the definition and summary given by Barrett:</p>

<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scripture is sufficient in that it is the only inspired, inerrant, and therefore final authority for Christians for
  faith and godliness, with all other authorities being subservient to Scripture.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sufficiency of Scripture is a doctrine challenged on multiple fronts. Ever since the Reformation, Rome challenged
  Scripture’s sufficiency in claiming that an infallible tradition and papal magisterium was necessary to provide the
  correct interpretation of Scripture. In response, the Reformers asserted that Scripture is a sufficient authority for
  all things pertaining to faith and godliness, not needing to appeal to another authority. However, this does not mean
  that Scripture functions alone apart from any other source or authority; rather, all other authorities serve under
  Scripture, while Scripture rules over them as the final and inspired authority from God.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="study-guide-answers">Study guide answers</h2>

<p>These are my answers to a study guide given by my pastor.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Does the sufficiency of Scripture mean we don’t need or shouldn’t use any other confessions, books, or sources in
our studies? Why or why not? Does the sufficiency of Scripture mean that it is the only authority? If not, what is
the relationship between Scripture and other authorities?
    <blockquote>
      <p>No, Barrett states</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>With that in mind, the Christian need not fear the use of extrabiblical sources. In fact, the Christian should
    have no hesitancy learning from, appealing to, and utilizing extrabiblical sources.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Barrett contrasts <em>sola scriptura</em> with <em>nuda scriptura</em>, the view that scripture is the <em>only</em> rule of faith to
  the exclusion of all other
  sources<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuda_scriptura#:~:text=the%20view%20that%20scripture%20is%20the%20only%20rule%20of%20faith%20to%20the%20exclusion%20of%20all%20other%20sources">*</a>. Evidently that view was found among the Anabaptists and radical reformers, and appears in modern day Fundamentalism. It appears that <em>nuda scriptura</em> is appealing to people who wish to
  emphasize the role of the Bible in daily life. However, it can lead to confusion about what exactly another
  “authority” or “tradition” might be. For example one might think that just because one’s church does not belong to
  a denomination, that church is therefore free from the theological influence of tradition. And this can lead
  people to elevate the position and authority of traditions within that individual church. Because if people think
  everything that church does and believes arises from the Bible and from the Bible alone, then things which are in
  fact mere tradition and artifacts of history begin to capture people’s consciences.</p>

      <p><em>Sola scriptura</em>, on the other hand, explicitly allows room for other authorities to function with scripture. But
  in a way that they serve and are corrected by scripture. The Apostles’ Creed, for example, is a wonderful
  distillation of truths arising from scripture. And it is also true that the Apostles’ Creed is not immune to
  critical thinking by interpreters of scripture—for example, what does it mean that “Christ descended into
  hell [and arose three days later]” when he promised the repentant thief “today you will be with me in paradise”
  Luke 23:43 (and arose three days later)? <em>Sola scriptura</em> empowers you to answer that question from scripture with
  a free conscience.</p>

      <p>I also find it helpful to think about the role of
  <a href="/christian/2023/08/02/scripture-as-divine-revelation.html">General Revelation</a> in relation to Special
  Revelation. Both are revelation from God. And if Special Revelation is true because God is true, then General
  Revelation is also just as true. Therefore, General Revelation is infallible. Therefore it’s legitimate to reason
  and draw conclusions from General Revelation, just as we do from scripture. However, we ought to be careful by
  remembering that General Revelation is less specific than scripture in many matters. And so we ought to reject any
  conclusions drawn from General Revelation that contradict necessary deductions from scripture. For example, even
  though a large body of science claims that the earth is many billions of years old, the Christian is more than
  free to reject that inference on the grounds of good and necessary deductions from scripture. And at the same time
  even people without access to the bible are obligated to believe that there is an eternal uncreated being—if
  anything exists and is an effect then by deduction there is an Uncaused Cause, and everyone knows that they their
  self exist, and only exist contingently. And so we see that good and necessary deductions can be drawn from sources
  other than scripture and can rightly bind people’s consciences, and scripture stands supreme.</p>

  <li>What is the difference between the Roman Catholic view of Scripture’s sufficiency and the view of the Reformers?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Barrett says:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Rome challenged Scripture’s sufficiency, claiming that an infallible tradition and papal magisterium is also
    needed to provide the one, true interpretation of Scripture. This conclusion stems from their assumption that
    tradition is a second infallible source or conduit of divine revelation.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The Catechism of the Catholic Church states,
  <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PK.HTM">beginning in paragraph 75</a>, the following things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Christ commanded the Apostles to preach the Gospel</li>
        <li>The Gospel was handed on in two ways: orally (leading to Sacred Tradition), and in writing (as Sacred Scripture
  and in later writings contributing to Sacred
  Tradition)<a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PK.HTM#:~:text=handed%20on%20in%20two%20ways">*</a></li>
        <li>The authority to preach the Gospel was passed along through generations of bishops as successors to the
  Apostles<a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PK.HTM#:~:text=bishops%20as%20their%20successors">*</a></li>
        <li>Both of these avenues of teaching preserve and perpetuate the Gospel and together are a “living transmission”
  called Sacred
  Tradition<a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PK.HTM#:~:text=78%20This-,living%20transmission,-%2C%20accomplished%20in%20the">*</a></li>
        <li>Both Scripture and Tradition are compatible, bound closely together, and inform one another in a dynamic flowing
  way<a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PL.HTM#:~:text=bound%20closely%20together">*</a></li>
        <li>Both Scripture and Tradition must be accepted and honored with equal sentiments of devotion and
  reverence<a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PL.HTM#:~:text=Both%20Scripture%20and%20Tradition%20must%20be%20accepted%20and%20honoured%20with%20equal%20sentiments%20of%20devotion%20and%20reverence">*</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p><br />
The Catholic Church finds the ability for herself to keep Scripture and Tradition in sync. In the above section of
  the Catechism she claims the help of the Holy Spirit. Additionally,
  <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PM.HTM#:~:text=The%20task%20of,Bishop%20of%20Rome.">paragraph 85</a>
  says:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The task of giving an authentic interpretation of the Word of God, whether in its written form or in the form of
    Tradition, has been entrusted to the living teaching office of the Church alone. Its authority in this matter is
    exercised in the name of Jesus Christ. This means that the task of interpretation has been entrusted to the
    bishops in communion with the successor of Peter, the Bishop of Rome.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p><br />
One could easily imagine that over time any teaching not committed to writing for preservation would tend to be
  corrupted and then lost, and any later doctrines built on such a foundation would be suspect. In Jesus’ day the
  Pharisees had so elevated their own tradition (which became corrupt over time) that it rose in practice to the
  position of supreme authority because it was their lens for authoritatively interpreting scripture, resulting in
  their own damnation (Matthew 23). And so Rome is correct to identify that it is dangerous to depart from scripture.
  The Catholic Church seeks shelter by appealing to two things: the Holy Spirit who keeps the Church from corruption;
  and to the inherited ability to tell people what the bible <em>really</em> says.</p>

      <p>Logically, with these safeguards in place there would be no possibility for Sacred Tradition to contradict Sacred
  Scripture in the eyes of lay people. Lay people are not allowed to understand Sacred Scripture in any other way
  than is delivered to them by the Church. Similarly, the teachers of the lay people are not allowed to teach
  anything from Sacred Scripture except what accords with their current understanding of Sacred Tradition. Instead,
  those teachers are excommunicated who contradict teachings of the Church.</p>

      <p>To assert these things as true, however, is question begging. How can a person know that the Catholic Church
  actually possesses the authority to infallibly interpret scripture? You have to accept the conclusion in order to
  believe the premise.</p>

      <p>And it’s my opinion that the Catholic Church has tied herself up in knots trying to maintain this over the
  centuries.</p>

      <p>The view of the Reformers stands in stark contrast. The Reformers recognized that God’s word has no equal, and
  that the bible is God’s word while other streams of teaching are not, even though other streams of teaching do
  often overlap significantly with the bible. Scripture alone bears the privilege of making people wise for salvation; other streams of gospel teaching are only profitable inasmuch as they align with scripture.</p>

      <p>Consequences of <em>sola scriptura</em> include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The ability for lay people to recognize mere traditions of men</li>
        <li>The ability for anyone to be freed from the burden they impose</li>
        <li>The ability to rest in Christ and simply trust him, knowing that no other means of salvation will arise in the
  future, and nothing else will ever be required for our justification</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What are two ways that modern Christians deny the sufficiency of Scripture, if not with their words, with their
actions?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Modern Christians can learn something from the Reformation with regard to <em>sola scriptura</em>. Barrett gives these
  examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Personal experience ought not act as a sieve which sifts scripture</li>
        <li>Pragmatism and sensitivity to the culture’s felt needs ought to yield to scripture
          <ul>
            <li>Scripture ought to be front and center in all songs and sermons</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><br />
This makes me think of how people tend to judge the continuation of certain Spiritual Gifts. On the one hand some
  will point to personal experience and say “I’ve seen them in action”, and that is the reason they believe it. This
  fails to let scripture judge the situation. But on the other hand some will construct an elaborate argument from
  scripture for why they cannot possibly be happening today, and the argument is full of statements like “and
  wouldn’t it make sense if …”, yet they seek to bind people’s consciences with this conclusion. This elevates a
  tradition of man insofar as such conclusions are <em>not</em> necessary conclusions from scripture. I’m not prepared to
  engage the issue much deeper than that, but it comes to mind.</p>

      <p>This also reminds me of how contemporary music tends to be introduced into churches. I engaged a little bit with
  this in
  <a href="/christian/2021/08/30/critique-josh-hunt.html">Introducing Contemporary Worship Into a Traditional Church</a>.
  I think that very often the motivation is to find a form of worship in church that appeals to the culture outside
  the church. But we really don’t have to worry too much about what appeals to the outside culture. Instead we need
  to just honor God with our worship, and let the culture think whatever they want about us. If we seem backward to
  the culture but God is pleased then who cares?</p>
