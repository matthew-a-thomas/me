Welcome!

I'm a Christian, a husband, a father, and a programmer. I like thinking about
things and teaching them to other people. I hope what I've written is helpful to
you.

## Contact

You can email me:

## This website

This website's source code (and all its content) is on GitHub:

[https://github.com/matthew-a-thomas/me](https://github.com/matthew-a-thomas/me){:target="_blank"}

One way to reference a particular snapshot in time of this website is by looking
through commits on the `gh-pages` branch:

[https://github.com/matthew-a-thomas/me/commits/gh-pages](https://github.com/matthew-a-thomas/me/commits/gh-pages){:target="_blank"}

## Leaving comments

At the bottom of each article is a link to a GitHub issue holding comments for
that article. There you'll be able to use
[GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/){:target="_blank"}
to style your comments.

If you want to participate in the conversation but don't have a GitHub account
then you'll need to create one. Sorry for that extra step, but it saves me a lot
of effort in setting up a secure comments system and controlling spam and bots.

Keep in mind your comments (and mine) must abide by GitHub's community
guidelines. [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines#what-is-not-allowed){:target="_blank"} is a list of
things they don't allow.

## Other feedback

Feel free to email me (email address above) or
