Matthew Barrett [wrote an essay on TGC](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/essay/scripture-divine-revelation/) titled
"Scripture as Divine Revelation".

These are my answers to a study guide given by my pastor. Hopefully my answers correctly summarize the essay.

1. Barrett gives a definition of Scripture that includes several elements. Identify these elements by answering the
   following questions:
   1. What is Scripture?
      > Scripture is the written form of God's special revelation.
   1. What kind of revelation is Scripture?
      > It is _special_ revelation, in contrast to _general_ revelation.
   1. Who is Scripture from?
      > Scripture is from God.
   1. Who is Scripture for?
      > Scripture is for God's people.
   1. What is included in Scripture?
      > Scripture includes the Old and New Testaments. It includes God's self-revelation. It includes the mysteries of
        the faith, and personal knowledge of Christ. It includes an enduring witness to the work of God in Christ.
   1. Is Scripture temporary?
      > No, scripture is an _enduring_ witness.
   1. What does the Holy Spirit accomplish through Scripture?
      > The Holy Spirit accomplishes the revelation of the Christ through scripture. It is through this witness that the
        Spirit brings God's people into union with the resurrected and ascended Christ. In other words, the Spirit makes
        Christ known to us in a saving way.
1. What is general revelation and what are two examples of general revelation?
   > General revelation is revelation that is available to all and less precise in what it reveals about God. It
     includes the knowledge that God is divine in nature and very powerful.
1. How is special revelation different from general revelation?
   > Special revelation is more specific in its content. Also it is omnipotent in its effect whereas general revelation
     may be suppressed by people. General revelation is also distinct in that it is received through man's internal
     conscience and through the created order, as opposed to special revelation which God communicated through various
     other mediums.
1. What are two reasons why it is extraordinary that God has spoken to us?
   > It is extraordinary that God has spoken to us because he is such an exalted being, higher than us brittle
     creatures, and utterly impossible to comprehend fully. And also because he is so very holy in contrast to us who
     are so very sinful. It is across these two great gulfs that God has spoken a gracious, redeeming word.
1. What does general revelation reveal about God? What doesnâ€™t it reveal about God?
   > General revelation reveals that God is creator. It also reveals many of his divine attributes. However it does not
     reveal the Trinity or the person and work of Christ.
1. There are different forms of special revelation. For example, God communicated through prophets, visions, and dreams
   in the Old Testament. How is Scripture different from these forms of special revelation?
   > Scripture is different from other mediums of special revelation in that the witness in scripture is enduring and
     permanent. Prophets died and many of their visions and dreams were not recorded in scripture and thus have been
     lost. Even Christ, who is himself the message and supreme self-revelation of God, ascended into the heavens and in
     that sense is not with us any longer. Scripture, on the other hand, is the Spirit's enduring, ever-present gift to
     God's people. We do not know Christ apart from the word of Christ inscripturated.
1. True or false. God revealed his written word progressively over time.
   > Yes, God revealed his written word progressively over time. In Barrett's words, "\[it\] did not fall from heaven
     all at once. Rather it was revealed progressively over the course of history and through human hands."
1. True or false. God revealed his word to every prophet in the same way that he revealed it to Moses on Mount Sinai.
   > No, not all later prophets had to ascend Sinai like Moses to bring down God's written word.
1. What does "inspiration" mean?
   > Inspiration is key for understanding the scriptures. It does not indicate that the human authors merely recorded
     their religious experience by "inspiring" events. Instead, all scripture is _breathed out_ by God, meaning they
     originated with God.
1. What did B. B. Warfield mean by the word "concursus"?
   > He intended to summarize 2 Peter 1:21 which states that men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy
     Spirit. By "concursus" he meant that there was a simultaneous operation between the human and the divine author,
     though the divine author is primary.
1. What is the greatest testimony to the inspiration of Scripture?
   > The greatest testimony to the inspiration and divine origin of scripture is the very common refrain in the
     scriptures that Jesus fulfills the covenant promises of God in them.
