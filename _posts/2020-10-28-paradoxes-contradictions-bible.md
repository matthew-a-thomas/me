description: A look at paradoxes, contradictions, and the Bible

A contradiction is when two mutually exclusive things are both said to be true
at the same time in the same sense. For example, it's a contradiction to say
&ldquo;this spot on the ball is red and not blue&rdquo; and &ldquo;the same spot
on the ball is blue and not red&rdquo; about the same spot on the same ball at
the same time in the same way. They are mutually exclusive statements and
there's a contradiction.

Contradictions are very useful. You can make
[proofs by contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction#Examples){:target="_blank"}.
You can also find contradictions within the framework of certain philosophies
which prove them to be wrong. Contradictions are very powerful things.

A paradox is when there appears to be a contradiction but in fact there isn't
_necessarily_ one. For example, it is paradoxical for one person to say
&ldquo;the ball is red&rdquo; and another person to say &ldquo;the ball is
blue&rdquo; about the same ball at the same time. But perhaps the ball is
painted white and the one person is shining a red light on it from one side
while the other person is shining a blue light on it from the other side. The
one person said it was red _in a sense_ while the other person said it was blue
_in a different sense_.

Paradoxes aren't very strong. A paradox might leave you feeling uneasy that you
don't understand something, but that's all.

Notice how I proved that the paradox wasn't a contradiction. All I had to do was
give a single possible explanation of how the paradox could be resolved. It
wasn't necessary for me to prove that the possible explanation was real. It's
much easier than that. All I had to do was give a _possible_ explanation.

So contradictions can be difficult to establish, and it is often easy to knock
supposed contradictions down to mere paradoxes.

## In the Bible

Many people claim to have found many contradictions in the Bible. That often
leads to discussing the reliability of the Bible. But I haven't come across one
yet that really is a contradiction. I'm not bragging (I want to trust in Jesus
alone, not in my own confidence). Instead I have found that what many are
calling contradictions are only paradoxes.

Here are some examples:

1. Peter denied Jesus once before and twice after the rooster crowed
   {% include verse.html verse="Mark 14:30" %};
   {% include verse.html verse="Mark 14:66-72" %}.
   Peter denied Jesus three times before the rooster crowed
   {% include verse.html verse="Luke 22:34" %};
   {% include verse.html verse="Luke 22:54-62" %}
1. There is only one God {% include verse.html verse="Deuteronomy 6:4" %};
   {% include verse.html verse="Isaiah 44:6" %}.
   Jesus is God {% include verse.html verse="John 1:1" %}. The Holy Spirit is
   God {% include verse.html verse="Acts 5:3-4" %}. The Father is God
   {% include verse.html verse="Philippians 1:2" %}. Jesus is not the Holy
   Spirit {% include verse.html verse="Matthew 3:16" %}. Jesus is not the Father
   {% include verse.html verse="Matthew 3:17" %}. The Holy Spirit is not the
   Father {% include verse.html verse="John 14:26" %}
1. Jesus said his contemporary generation would not pass away until He came
   again {% include verse.html verse="Matthew 24:30-34" %}

But these are only paradoxes. Here are some possible explanations:

1. Perhaps &ldquo;when the rooster crows&rdquo; is an idiom that meant different
   things to the different original audiences. Each of the gospels were written
   to different audiences. Therefore it's possible that the gospel writers used
   an idiom in a peculiar way familiar to their audience, similar to
   [this idea](https://apologeticspress.org/apcontent.aspx?category=6&article=759#ctl00_cphPage_BblQuesContent_lblContentAuthors:~:text=A%20family%20of%20three%20went%20to,claim%20that%20Ricky%20had%20contradicted%20himself.){:target="_blank"}
1. Perhaps there is a single divine being and three distinct divine persons.
   That would mean that God is one in a different way than He is three.
   Therefore it is possible that God can be one (in a sense) at the same time He
   is three (in another sense)
1. Perhaps Jesus figuratively returned in judgment in 70 A.D. by sending the
   Roman armies that sacked Jerusalem

## The point

Don't be quick to think you've found a contradiction in the Bible. You probably
only have a paradox.
