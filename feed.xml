<p>(Assuming a normal four-stroke engine that would otherwise idle fine.)</p>

<p>The intuition is that in order to make the engine complete a full four-stroke cycle, you’re going to have to overcome the compression stroke of at least one piston. Yet the compression ratio of the engine is always greater than 1:1 (the motor in my car has a compression ratio of 10.5:1). Therefore it will always take more force on the piston to complete the first compression stroke than the force that you’ll get from 1 atmosphere of pressure. Yet a vacuum can only give you the force of up to 1 atmosphere of pressure.</p>

<p>Remember, it’s the starting conditions that you have to overcome in order to start the engine. So while the intake pressure of an already idling engine will be negative (relative to ambient) and thus the peak pressure of its compression stroke will be much lower, a stopped engine that needs to be started doesn’t have this luxury. And even if it did, that negative intake pressure would be working against your vacuum on the exhaust.</p>

<p>I’m not sure there is one.

Here’s what <a href="https://hymnary.org/media/fetch/96169"><em>Amazing Grace</em></a> looks like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> -               A 3 1

 -  1 4      1 4  2 1 1         1 4
       2        2                  2
G- 4 1  4   4 1        4  11   4 1  A
 #
 -       2               3  1
  2       42            2    42
R
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You read it from left to right. The first column tells where G4 is (G4 is the second line from the bottom in the treble clef), and also tells where the “rest” line is. The second column is for the key signature: “b” means the notes on that line are flat; “#” means they are sharp. <em>Amazing Grace</em> is in the key of G major so all the lines for “F”s are sharp. Then a single number is in each of the following columns.</p>

<p>You use the number “1” for the shortest note in the song. <em>Amazing Grace</em> has eighth notes (but not sixteenth notes) so for it “1” means “eighth note”, “2” means “quarter note”, and so on. The number has to fit in a single column but 1–9 is a pretty limited range, so actually it’s a base 36 number (A = 10, B = 11, and so on).</p>

<p>Maybe later I’ll post my code for parsing this format into C# data objects, and for determining the frequency and duration of each note. I’m currently using that code to generate stepper motor commands to make a stepper motor sing songs for me.</p>

<p>I find this format easy to author (once you get the hang of it) and not too bad to parse… perfect for toy projects.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A toy file format for simple songs]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Air Spring Preload</title><link href="/misc/2023/08/18/air-spring-preload.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Air Spring Preload" /><published>2023-08-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-08-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/misc/2023/08/18/air-spring-preload</id><content type="html" xml:base="/misc/2023/08/18/air-spring-preload.html"><![CDATA[<p>You can make an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_suspension">air spring</a> from an air piston like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>         load

   ^ cylinder cap ^
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As long as the air inside the piston has nowhere to go, it’ll be springy.</p>

<p>What follows is a quick proof that adding preload makes the air spring stiffer.</p>

<h2 id="proof">Proof</h2>

<p>According to gas laws, an isothermic (meaning thermal equilibrium) air spring obeys this principle:</p>

\[P_1 \cdot V_1 = P_2 \cdot V_2\]

<p>In other words, the pressure multiplied by the volume remains the same.</p>

<p>Now, a force is pressure multiplied over an area:</p>

\[F = P \cdot A\]

\[P = \frac{F}{A}\]

<p>Which means,</p>

\[\frac{F_1}{A_1} \cdot V_1 = \frac{F_2}{A_2} \cdot V_2\]

\[F_1 \cdot h_1 = F_2 \cdot h_2\]

\[\frac{F_1}{F_2} = \frac{h_2}{h_1}\]

<p>In other words, the ratio between the forces equals the inverse ratio between the heights.</p>

<p>Now, suppose that we preload it. Meaning add something to <em>both</em> forces, not just one of them. Using the picture above, if you increase the load on top then that’s increasing one force, and that will be greeted by an equally opposing force (from squashed air).</p>

\[F = \alpha + G\]

\[\frac{\alpha + G_1}{\alpha + G_2} = \frac{h_2}{h_1}\]

<p>“Stiffness” can be understood in terms of the change in that ratio \(\frac{h_2}{h_1}\). The smaller the change, the stiffer it is.</p>

<p>So let’s pretend that the forces and heights are constant. What effect does the preload have on the rate of change of that ratio?</p>

<p>Take the partial derivative of the left side:</p>

\[\frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} \frac{\alpha + G_1}{\alpha + G_2} = \frac{G_2 - G_1}{(G_2 + \alpha)^2}\]

<p>See the \(\alpha\) (squared) in the denominator? That means the rate of change of that ratio goes to zero as \(\alpha\) (the preload) increases.</p>

<p>In other words, an air spring gets stiffer when you add preload.</p>

<p>Just like any spring.</p>

<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>

<p>There are multiple applications of this.</p>

<h3 id="compressed-gas-springs">Compressed gas springs</h3>

<p>There are multiple ways to add preload. One way is to put a weight on top like my example above. But another way is to enclose the top of the air piston and fill that space with <em>compressed</em> air. Then you get a compressed gas spring.</p>

<h3 id="make-an-air-piston-less-slingshot-y">Make an air piston less slingshot-y</h3>

<p>Suppose you replaced all the hydraulic cylinders in your excavator with air pistons. You have to work <em>really</em> hard to lift a heavy rock by pumping a ton of very compressed air into the air pistons. Then as the rock begins to lift it slips and falls out of the bucket. Guess what happens to all that compressed air? It decompresses by violently slingshotting the bucket off of your excavator and sending it into orbit. I hope you have insurance.</p>

<p>That’s a silly example. But there are real life usages of air cylinders that move loads, and sometimes loads shift.</p>

<p>How can you make it less like a slingshot? Add preload.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="misc" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adding preload makes an air spring stiffer, just like any spring]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Things in C# Over Which You Cannot Abstract</title><link href="/programming/2023/08/16/impossible-csharp-abstractions.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Things in C# Over Which You Cannot Abstract" /><published>2023-08-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-08-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/programming/2023/08/16/impossible-csharp-abstractions</id><content type="html" xml:base="/programming/2023/08/16/impossible-csharp-abstractions.html"><![CDATA[<p>I love abstractions. One of my favorite things about software is finding, making, and using good abstractions.</p>

<p>C# has many wonderful abstractions.</p>

<p>But C# also has concepts and features over which it’s simply not possible to abstract.</p>

<h2 id="ref-struct"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref struct</code></h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref</code> keyword was introduced to enable performance optimizations. When you make a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref</code> type then you’re telling the compiler that its instances can only live on the stack. They cannot live on the heap.</p>

<p>This has <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/ref-struct">the following consequences</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref struct</code> can’t be the element type of an array.</li>
    <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref struct</code> can’t be a declared type of a field of a class or a non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref struct</code>.</li>
    <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref struct</code> can’t implement interfaces.</li>
    <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref struct</code> can’t be boxed to System.ValueType or System.Object.</li>
    <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref struct</code> can’t be a type argument.</li>
    <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref struct</code> variable can’t be captured by a lambda expression or a local function.</li>
    <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref struct</code> variable can’t be used in an async method. However, you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref struct</code> variables in synchronous methods, for example, in methods that return Task or Task<TResult>.</TResult></li>
    <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref struct</code> variable can’t be used in iterators.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a long list of things you can’t do with them!</p>

<p>Let’s zoom in on the fact that they can’t implement interfaces. Which are one of the primary tools for abstraction in C#.</p>

<p>Suppose you want a function that will return the sum of all the odd elements of a sequence of numbers:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">SumOdd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IEnumerable</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="n">sequence</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">sum</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">foreach</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">number</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">sequence</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">even</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="n">even</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">false</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">else</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="n">even</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
      <span class="n">sum</span> <span class="p">+=</span> <span class="n">number</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">sum</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because of the power of abstraction you can use that function on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int[]</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">List&lt;int&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImmutableList&lt;int&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArraySegment&lt;int&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IReadOnlyCollection&lt;int&gt;</code>, and so on:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">Assert</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Equal</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nf">SumOdd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">4</span> <span class="p">}));</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But you cannot use that function on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ReadOnlySpan&lt;int&gt;</code>. Instead you have to make a choice:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Duplicate the function with minimal changes to support <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ReadOnlySpan&lt;int&gt;</code>

</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Pointlessly copy the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ReadOnlySpan&lt;int&gt;</code> into an array:

  </li>
  <li><em>Sometimes</em> you’ll have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ReadOnlyMemory&lt;int&gt;</code> within scope from which the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ReadOnlySpan&lt;int&gt;</code> came.

</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>…but now we’re no longer talking about abstracting over <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ReadOnlySpan&lt;int&gt;</code>. Which is kind of the point</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So you cannot abstract over <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref struct</code>.</p>

<h2 id="most-all-c-coding-by-convention-concepts">Most (all?) C# coding-by-convention concepts</h2>

<p>Here are some examples of what I mean by “coding by convention”:</p>

        <li>The return type of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GetEnumerator</code> method has the public <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Current</code> property and the public parameterless <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MoveNext</code> method whose return type is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bool</code>.</li>

  </li>
  <li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/using"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">using</code> statements</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>You can also use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">using</code> statement and declaration with an instance of a ref struct that fits the disposable pattern. That is, it has an instance <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dispose</code> method, which is accessible, parameterless and has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">void</code> return type.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/expressions#12982-awaitable-expressions"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await</code> operator</a>
    <blockquote>

        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t</code> has an accessible instance or extension method called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GetAwaiter</code> with no parameters and no type parameters, and a return type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> for which all of the following hold:

    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are a growing number of things like this in C# where you’ll be able to use this or that feature if you follow a bunch of rules.</p>

<p>But it’s impossible to abstract over all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foreach</code>-able types, or all disposable types, or all awaitable types. Because with each of these features C# introduced a convention, and a convention is different than an interface. It doesn’t matter if they also introduced an interface (as is the case with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foreach</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IEnumerable</code>, or with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">using</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IDisposable</code>)—the fact that they introduced a convention at all means there will be types which are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foreach</code>-able that do not implement an interface.</p>

<p>It’s impossible to abstract over <em>all</em> manifestations of any of these concepts.</p>

<h2 id="colored-functions">Colored functions</h2>

<p>C# pioneered <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">async</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await</code>. And so <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">colored functions</a> are C#’s fault.</p>

<p>Yes, async cancer is a real thing. I’ve experienced it. You are twelve layers deep in a project with 10,000 source code files and discover that you need to call an asynchronous function from a synchronous function.

It contains a certification by an official censor that it’s free of doctrinal or moral errors, so it seems pretty legit.</p>

<p>I’d like to ask some questions as I think critically about it. Perhaps I’ll flesh this post out with additional research as I have time. But for now there will probably only be questions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vatican II explained the doctrine of infallibility as follows: “Although the individual bishops do not enjoy the prerogative of infallibility, they can nevertheless proclaim Christ’s doctrine infallibly. This is so, even when they are dispersed around the world, provided that while maintaining the bond of unity among themselves and with Peter’s successor, and while teaching authentically on a matter of faith or morals, they concur in a single viewpoint as the one which must be held conclusively. This authority is even more clearly verified when, gathered together in an ecumenical council, they are teachers and judges of faith and morals for the universal Church. Their definitions must then be adhered to with the submission of faith” (<em>Lumen Gentium</em> 25).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m struggling to understand this. I <em>think</em> this is what is being said:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Individual bishops are fallible</li>
  <li>Nevertheless, they are able to do one thing infallibly: proclaim doctrine
    <ul>
      <li><em>If</em> they remain joined to the pope</li>
      <li><em>If</em> their teaching accords with the doctrine in question</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It’s that last bullet point that I don’t understand. How can a person know if a bishop’s teaching accords with the doctrine in question? I think that judgment could only be made with certainty if the pope and a general council meet and agree? But then who can bring that infallible judgment down so that it is infallibly within reach of the lay person? Would it not have to be a bishop, which simply raises the question again? Because how can a person know if that bishop’s teaching on that infallible judgment, is itself in accord with that infallible judgment?</p>

<p>Otherwise it seems that people have to just <em>assume</em> that a bishop’s teaching accords, and then <em>assume</em> that his teaching is infallible in that instance. So infallibility is reduced to a mere assumption?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Infallibility belongs in a special way to the pope as head of the bishops (Matt. 16:17–19; John 21:15–17). As Vatican II remarked, it is a charism the pope “enjoys in virtue of his office, when, as the supreme shepherd and teacher of all the faithful, who confirms his brethren in their faith (Luke 22:32), he proclaims by a definitive act some doctrine of faith or morals. Therefore his definitions, of themselves, and not from the consent of the Church, are justly held irreformable, for they are pronounced with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, an assistance promised to him in blessed Peter.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How solemnly, or in what form, must the pope make proclamation? And again, how can a person know infallibly that the pope has followed the proper procedure? Or what the pope has said?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An infallible pronouncement—whether made by the pope alone or by an ecumenical council—usually is made only when some doctrine has been called into question. Most doctrines have never been doubted by the large majority of Catholics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is an appeal to purity (No True Scotsman). A Catholic is one who never calls anything significant into question, until he does. At which point he’s no longer Catholic? so it’s still true that nothing has been doubted by the large majority of Catholics. Otherwise a falsifying example would be the Reformation, when a <em>very</em> significant number of Catholics began doubting many <em>major</em> doctrines.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some ask how popes can be infallible if some of them lived scandalously. This objection, of course, illustrates the common confusion between infallibility and impeccability. There is no guarantee that popes won’t sin or give bad example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_XII">Pope John XII</a> is a popular example of a pope living scandalously. He was excommunicated, declared to be apostate, and died shamefully. Indeed, if any kind of infallibility is present in the papacy, then this guy is proof that it comes with absolutely no guarantee of impeccability.</p>

<p>But I have a question about this. Above, Catholic Answers said a bishop is infallible while “maintaining the bond of unity […] with Peter’s successor”. Surely Pope John XII was not maintaining that bond. So in his case he possessed the gift of infallibility by nature of his office (he was pope), while simultaneously he did not “enjoy the prerogative of infallibility” due to his sins? If so, then to me that feels like the fallacy of division (I think that’s the name for it?)—the doctrine arises out of a study of generalities, but then is used to overrule any contradicting specifics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Other people wonder how infallibility could exist if some popes disagreed with others. This, too, shows an inaccurate understanding of infallibility, which applies only to solemn, official teachings on faith and morals, not to disciplinary decisions or even to unofficial comments on faith and morals. A pope’s private theological opinions are not infallible; only what he solemnly defines is considered to be infallible teaching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How solemnly? How “officially”?</p>

<p>How can a person know <em>infallibly</em> that threshold has been reached? If you cannot know it infallibly, then you cannot know that the solemn official teaching is infallible, and so infallibility is an assumption or a courtesy.</p>

<p>I believe it’s Catholic teaching that popes may err in matters of fact. Therefore isn’t it possible that a pope may err in saying “I solemnly and officially teach this”? Therefore you cannot know it is infallible without already knowing it’s infallible.</p>

<p>Are there not examples of solemn, official teachings on faith and morals within the history of the Catholic Church which disagree with each other? I’ve heard allegations that there are.</p>

<p>If they do not disagree, how do you know that infallibly? Wouldn’t certainty on the matter require the intervention of a bishop, and infallible knowledge of it would require the pope with a council. But then how would you know infallibly whether the pope and the council are in agreement, unless you already assume that they agree. In which case isn’t it meaningless to say they must agree, because it’s question begging to state they must agree and to mean the determination of their agreement is a presumption.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a biblical example of papal fallibility, Fundamentalists like to point to Peter’s conduct at Antioch, where he refused to eat with Gentile Christians in order not to offend certain Jews from Palestine (Gal. 2:11–16). For this Paul rebuked him. Did this demonstrate papal infallibility was non-existent? Not at all. Peter’s actions had to do with matters of discipline, not with issues of faith or morals. Furthermore, the problem was Peter’s actions, not his teaching. Paul acknowledged that Peter very well knew the correct teaching (Gal. 2:12–13).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Peter’s actions had nothing to do with issues of faith or morals? That’s absurd. He was leading people astray (Gal 2:13), which is certainly an issue of both faith and morals.</p>

<p>So Peter’s actions have no teaching role whatsoever? That’s also absurd.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fundamentalists must also acknowledge that Peter did have some kind of infallibility—they cannot deny that he wrote two infallible epistles of the New Testament while under protection against writing error. So, if his behavior at Antioch was not incompatible with this kind of infallibility, neither is bad behavior contrary to papal infallibility in general.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree that Peter had some kind of infallibility with respect to authoring his scriptures. So yes, Peter’s misconduct did not nullify the epistles he wrote. I even have to admit that Solomon’s misconduct did not nullify Proverbs or Song of Songs.</p>

<p>But I think Pope John XII could rightly be called a slave of the devil without any offense to Catholics. So isn’t it an entirely different thing to say the popes are the rock and foundation of the church, helping to preserve her from the gates of hell, when at least one pope is himself a slave of hell? How can a hellish foundation save from hell? And then how can infallibility be derived from implications of <em>that</em>? That certainly requires additional explanation, to say the least.</p>

<h2 id="in-summary">In summary</h2>

<p>I think I’m left wondering these things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the function of the Catholic doctrine of infallibility?</li>
  <li>It seems people can never have complete certainty of things which are supposedly infallible
    <ol>
      <li>How then is infallibility any better than an assumption or courtesy?</li>
      <li>How do Catholics resolve the facts of fallible knowledge of infallibility, and fallible usages of it?</li>
      <li>Similarly, how certain must a Catholic be of the infallibility of something in order to perform the functions of it?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>I think I’ve detected a couple instances of question begging, and one or two other fallacies
    <ul>
      <li>How can this doctrine be established without logical fallacies?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I think some of these questions will be easy to answer with additional research.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="catholicism" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Questions that arise from a Catholic Answers tract]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Matthew Poole, GPT Style</title><link href="/misc/2023/08/15/matthew-poole-chatgpt.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Matthew Poole, GPT Style" /><published>2023-08-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-08-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/misc/2023/08/15/matthew-poole-chatgpt</id><content type="html" xml:base="/misc/2023/08/15/matthew-poole-chatgpt.html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been reading a book written by Matthew Poole, a 17th century English Reformed Baptist, called <em>A Dialogue Between a Priest and a Protestant</em>. I thought it would be fun to make GPT-4 pretend to be him while talking with another instance of itself pretending to be a 17th century Roman Catholic priest.</p>

<p>I seeded the conversation with this message from the “priest”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aren’t you aware that Matthew 16:18 proves the infallibility of the Roman Catholic Church? Because the church is built on Peter, the rock. This rock includes his successors. The church built upon this rock is infallible because “the gates of hell shall not prevail against it”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instance 2, “Matthew Poole”, replies:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While I recognize the passage you mention, I firmly believe that the interpretation you offer does not align with the full context of the Word of God.</p>

  <p>Matthew 16:18 does say, “And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it”. However, it is important to determine what ‘this rock’ refers to. Many theologians, including myself, hold to the belief that ‘this rock’ refers to the confession that Peter just made - ‘You are the Christ, the Son of the living God’ in verse 16, the true foundation of the church, rather than Peter himself.</p>

  <p>Consequently, the church isn’t constructed on Peter or any human, but upon the truth of Jesus Christ’s divine identity and Messiahship. This interpretation finds support in Ephesians 2:19-20, speaking of the church as being “built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone.”</p>

  <p>As for infallibility, the Bible makes it clear that only God is infallible. Even Peter, chosen apostle of Christ, made mistakes and was rebuked (Galatians 2:11-14). The church, while the bride of Christ, is still made up of fallible human beings. The assurance in Matthew 16:18 that “the gates of Hades will not overcome it” is not a promise of the church’s infallibility, but rather of its ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the belief in the infallibility of the Pope, as a successor of Peter, lacks scriptural foundation. Additionally, this concept may even detract from the sole, true infallibility and authority of God and His Word.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instance 1, the “priest”, replies:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Matthew, my friend, I thank you for your thoughtful answer. Yet, I cannot agree. You say that ‘this rock’ refers to Peter’s confession. While Peter’s confession is indeed significant, the phrase ‘on this rock’, given its lexical and grammatical construction, more plausibly refers not to the confession, but to Peter himself. This is made even evident by the play on words between Peter (Petros in Greek) and rock (petra in Greek).</p>

  <p>In Ephesians 2:19-20, while it is true that Christ is the cornerstone, it also lists the apostles (including Peter) as the foundation. Surely the foundation of a building is critical to its stability and endurance, just as Peter and his successors are critical to the Church’s.</p>

  <p>As for your point on infallibility, when we say the Church is infallible, we do not mean that its members are free from error or sin; rather, we mean that, in matters of faith and morals, the universal Church cannot err, when gathered in a council or Pope alone when he speaks ‘ex cathedra’. This promise is God’s, and it would go against His nature to allow His Church to fall into doctrinal error.</p>

  <p>So, regardless of Peter’s personal fallibility, the Holy Spirit preserves the Church from error. Yes, Peter had to be corrected by Paul, but this was a personal failing, something Peter repented for. Galatians 2:11-14 actually strengthens the argument for papal infallibility, as despite Peter’s personal failings, he never taught heresy to the Church.</p>

  <p>By fiercely remaining in the belief in the infallibility of the Pope, we preserve the credibility of the Gospel message, pure and unchanged, through centuries. To challenge this doctrine is to introduce the danger of division and splintering, which as we have seen, has caused a myriad of interpretations and denominations each with their own versions of truth. This rails against Christ’s prayer in John 17:21 that His followers be one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Poole:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I thank you as well for your thoughtful response and respect your faithfulness to your impressions and beliefs. However, let me offer a counterpoint.</p>

  <p>I acknowledge the play on words in the Greek text between ‘Peter’ (Petros) and ‘rock’ (petra), but it’s noteworthy that in the Aramaic language, which Christ would have likely used, the word for rock is ‘Cephas’, which is the name Christ gave to Simon (John 1:42).</p>

  <p>In the case of Ephesians 2:19-20, the Apostle Paul is stating that the church is built upon the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus Himself as the corner stone, not that they themselves are the foundation. If the apostles were the foundation, then there would be multiple foundations, but 1 Corinthians 3:11 makes clear: “For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.”</p>

  <p>When we talk about infallibility, it is important to delineate that humans, even those with spiritual authority, are fallible. While I acknowledge that church leaders are guided by the Holy Spirit, they can make mistakes and do often require correction (as we’ve observed with Peter in Galatians 2:11-14).</p>

  <p>To claim that any church leader, including the Pope, is infallible – even just in matters of faith and morals - is to place that individual’s authority on the same level as Scripture, which I believe is the only inspired, inerrant and thus infallible authority.</p>

  <p>By maintaining the inerrancy of Scripture and the fallibility of people, we can guard against potential human errors and keep our faith grounded in God’s Word. True unity is found in the truth of Scripture, and Christ prayed not only for unity, but for our sanctification in the truth: “Sanctify them in the truth,” He prayed, “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). Therefore, divisions amongst denominations are reminders of human fallibility, but it does not prevent the essential unity of the universal church, which is founded on the truth of the Gospel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Priest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Matthew, I’m delighted by your dedication to Holy Scripture and thoughtful discourse. It is a strong reminder that we are all seeking after truth and agreement in our shared faith in Christ, despite our differing interpretations.</p>

  <p>I fully concur with you that Jesus Christ is the true foundation. Yet, I maintain, He also established a clear hierarchy, in which the apostles, Peter being chief among them, play a paramount role in leading the Church. We still see this hierarchy in action today, with the Pope, bishops, and priests, whom Christ uses as instruments for His Church on earth.</p>

  <p>Regarding infallibility, the issue appears to hinge on an understanding of authority. Is it possible for God to confer upon a man, through the Holy Spirit, infallibility in certain instances—namely, defining dogma for the universal Church? Catholics believe it is, particularly when Jesus said what you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven (Matthew 16:19); He gave the Church, under Peter’s and his successors’ leadership, authentic governing authority, hence the doctrine of infallibility.</p>

  <p>Scripture in hand, tradition and magisterial authority should also guide a Christian in matters of faith and morals. This doesn’t depreciate the authority of Holy Scripture; rather, it acknowledges that Scripture exists within the context of the Church. The New Testament itself came to us through the Church’s tradition.</p>

  <p>Returning to the theme of unity, true unity comes from abiding in the truth of the Gospel, as you rightly noted. But, when left without a single, visible authority, as in the case with the numerous Protestant denominations, what results is a varied range of interpretations, even on critical points of faith. Surely, this is not the unity Christ desired for His Church.</p>

  <p>We both strive for unity in our shared faith in Christ, and I trust that we can keep this dialogue in a charitable spirit. May God guide us both into all truth (John 16:13).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Poole:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I appreciate your thoughtful response and admire your dedication to your convictions. We can indeed find agreement in our shared commitment to pursue truth and unity in Christ.</p>

  <p>You correctly acknowledge that Christ established a system of earthly stewardship for His Church. We find this in the form of apostles, elders, deacons, and more. However, I would hesitate to place Peter as “chief” among them, and would instead assert that all apostles were of equal authority and tasked to work together in spreading the Gospel and guiding the early church. Evidence of this equality can be found when Paul corrected Peter in Galatians 2:11-14, which indicates an equal authority among apostles, rather than a superior-inferior relationship.</p>

  <p>On the topic of infallibility, I do acknowledge that Jesus conferred upon the disciples the ability to “bind” and “loose” (Matthew 16:19), but this is often understood as the authority to establish church discipline and to declare what is lawful or unlawful according to God’s Word—not a blanket statement of infallibility.</p>

  <p>As a Baptist, I firmly hold that the “sola scriptura” doctrine is crucial to maintaining the purity of the gospel message and the authority of God’s Word. We view Scripture as the ultimate, inerrant, and inspired authority on all matters of the faith—and it must serve as the judge for any tradition or church teaching. It is not so much that Scripture exists within the context of the Church, but rather the Church should exist and operate within the context of Scripture.</p>

  <p>Regarding unity, I concede that the lack of a single visible authority may result in a variety of interpretations of the Scripture. But on the other hand, it is equally dangerous to rest the interpretation of Scripture in the hands of a single authority, which if mistaken, can lead the entire Church into error. Besides, it is the Holy Spirit who guides believers in correctly understanding the Word of God (John 16:13).</p>

  <p>I trust that as long as we maintain this respectful dialogue, we will continue to refine our understanding of our shared faith and be drawn closer to the true knowledge of the Gospel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Priest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Matthew, undeniably, your engagement in this theological discourse is commendable, demonstrating your earnestness in seeking truth.</p>

  <p>While all apostles were granted authority, we perceive the Bible as assigning a unique leadership role to Peter. This surfaces not only in Matthew 16:18, but also in multiple occasions where Peter’s name is most frequently listed first in the apostolic lists (Matthew 10:2, Mark 3:16, and Luke 6:14), or when he is often the spokesperson for the rest of the apostles (e.g., Matthew 18:21, Acts 2:14, 2:37-38, 5:29). In essence, while all apostles were granted authority, Peter was indeed first among equals.</p>

  <p>The power to “bind” and “loose” is indeed about the authority to establish the Church’s rules, often having to do with faith and morals, and therein does the Church’s infallibility lie, not as a blanket statement, but specifically about dogmas defined ‘ex cathedra’. It’s not a personal attribute of the Pope, rather it’s a protection provided by the Holy Spirit to maintain Church’s teaching freedom from error.</p>

  <p>I understand your fidelity to ‘sola scriptura’. However, the majority of the early church was illiterate, and for nearly half of its existence, even printed versions of the Scriptures were rare. The Church relied on oral tradition, liturgy and the Magisterium to teach the faith. Let us not forget, the Church preceded the New Testament and without the Church’s authority, we wouldn’t have the canon of Scripture.</p>

  <p>For certain, the spectrum of interpretations and denominations in Protestantism seems to run counter to the “one body” that is repeatedly emphasized in Scripture (Romans 12:4-5, 1 Corinthians 10:17, 12:12-27, Ephesians 4:4) which necessitates a visible unity. I echo your sentiment about the danger in investing interpretative power solely on one authority. Nevertheless, with the Holy Spirit’s safeguarding, we trust our singular authority continues to lead us truthfully.</p>

  <p>Thank you, my dear friend, for this enriching dialogue. Pursuing truth can understandably create difference in thought. Yet, “even though we speak like this, dear friends,” we are “convinced of better things in your case—the things that have to do with salvation” (Hebrews 6:9).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Poole:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your shared commitment to dialogue that illumines understanding is clearly illustrated. Your insights regarding Peter indeed represent a popular perspective within the Catholic tradition. However, I would gently suggest that the frequency of Peter’s name and his role as spokesperson don’t tangibly establish him as a supreme authority. Nor do they indicate that this role should pass down to successors.</p>

  <p>Additionally, while acknowledging the authority given to the apostles to “bind” and “loose”, I maintain that this authority was founded in Scriptural truth and does not imply infallibility. Paul’s admonition to Timothy in 2 Timothy 2:15 to “rightly divide the word of truth” implies an evident possibility for human error in interpretation and teaching.</p>

  <p>As for ‘sola scriptura’, I understand that the early church indeed relied on oral tradition, liturgy, and the understanding of the faith embedded within the early church community. However, my key assertion is that these elements should not hold equal authority to Scripture but should continually be tested against Scripture to safeguard against fallible human interpretation.</p>

  <p>1 John 4:1 emphasises the necessity of testing spirits, or messages, to see whether they are from God. Scripture stands as the original message given by God and thus, by definition, is the ‘gold standard’ by which all subsequent messages must be measured.</p>

  <p>I recognise that Protestantism consists of multiple interpretations and denominations, and I agree that it is the “one body” ideal that the Scripture emphasises. Nonetheless, the ‘body’ is not unified by human agreement but by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in each member.</p>

  <p>In Ephesians 4:3-4, Paul urges believers to “maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.” This unity stems from shared agreement on the fundamental tenets of Christianity including, most importantly, salvation by faith alone in Christ alone, and not precisely uniform agreement on doctrines.</p>

  <p>It is truly a pleasure to converse with you in this matter. Despite our differences, I believe that as we both strive to glorify God and uphold the truth of the Gospel, we find common ground that binds us together in the love of Christ, and His prayer for unity among believers (John 17:20-23) remains at the centre of our intentions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Priest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Matthew, I wholeheartedly agree that our common ground in Christ is much more significant than our differing interpretations. While having these discussions, it’s crucial to remember that we belong to the same body of Christ, striving for unity in truth and love.</p>

  <p>Though we interpret Scripture and tradition differently, we both acknowledge their immense value. Indeed, I would propose that we rely on them both, as trained minds are wont to do, to guide us toward truth. After all, both Scripture and tradition spring from the same divine wellspring, yes?</p>

  <p>Indeed, the call to “rightly divide the word of truth” in 2 Timothy 2:15 suggests the possibility of error in human understanding. All the more reason, I might add, for the guidance of a consecrated authority. As our Lord Jesus Christ said, “When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth” (John 16:13), hence the Church’s unwavering trust in the infallibility of its Magisterium in faith and morals.</p>

  <p>As for the role of Peter and subsequently the Pope, we may have to agree to disagree on this interpretation. Yet, it’s only together, reflecting our love and trust in Christ, we can work towards the ideal Church Jesus wanted - one that is unified in the Spirit and bond of peace.</p>

  <p>Our unity as believers indeed extends beyond exact doctrinal uniformity to encompass shared belief in crucial Christian tenets and the love of Christ. I trust that as long as we remain in Christ, we sustain our kinship as part of His Body.</p>

  <p>Our conversation has been a privileged and enlightening journey. I respect our differences and esteem our shared commitment to the body of believers and the truth of the Gospel. Let us continue in such discourse, always acknowledging that its purpose is to edify and build up the Body of Christ. It’s through these dialogues that unity in diversity is best illustrated. As Paul reminded us, “For as in one body we have many members, and not all the members have the same function, so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually, we are members one of another.” (Romans 12:4-5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Poole:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Indeed, my friend, I concur that our shared commitment to Christ and His Gospel is far greater than our different interpretations. Our conversations are a testament to the respect and shared love we have for the Gospel and Christ’s Church.</p>

  <p>Scripture and tradition are certainly essential and value-laden. However, as a Baptist, I maintain that it is the Scripture that should have the final authority in matters of faith and doctrine. Though we hold different views regarding the interpretation of the relationship between the two, our common purpose lies in seeking the truth in order to know and serve God better.</p>

  <p>Our differences on the concept of infallibility and the role of Peter and the Pope are indeed substantial. Still, we agree that the ultimate guide in understanding God’s Word and His intent for His Church is the Holy Spirit. My conviction remains that definitive authority lies in the Scripture, through which the Holy Spirit inspired and continues to guide us today.</p>

  <p>Despite our differences, we indeed share a unity in faith, belief, and love in Christ. As long as we pledge allegiance to Christ, we continue to be part of the same Body. Our dialogue is not about winning arguments but about learning, growing, and drawing closer to understanding God’s truth together.</p>

  <p>Indeed, our conversations have been richly rewarding and enlightening. I value our shared commitment to the enrichment and unity of the Body of Christ and to the proclamation of the Gospel. And as you cited so aptly from Romans 12:4-5, though we may perform different functions and hold differing perspectives, we are one Body in Christ. May we press on steadfastly in pursuit of truth, bound by our shared love for Christ, remembering always that it is the Spirit of God who unites us and works through us.</p>

<h2 id="observations">Observations</h2>

<p>The conversation eventually results in both of them hugging each other and singing kumbaya. I actually did this exercise twice. Both times GPT did this. Even though I told both sides that “serious and grave error” is at stake.</p>

<p>Other than that the points that each AI raised sound like points that would legitimately be raised by either side. And they are answered in a manner that to me seems mostly consistent with either position. Except the end where they start getting along and agreeing with each other because their differences apparently aren’t important to either one, even though I told both sides that “serious and grave error” is at stake.</p>

<p>So I guess GPT is able to skillfully argue any point you want it to? And without caring for the truth of the issue, because the two positions above are incompatible, so logically at least one of them is wrong, yet it argues both with the same effort. And it seems bent on giving you warm fuzzy feelings about everything, even when “serious and grave error” is at stake.</p>

<a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/online-edition/the-protestants-biggest-bible-problem">an article on Catholic.com</a>.</p>

<p>I’d like to quote a large section of it. Then I’d like to quibble over words. Then I’d like to put the quibble’s feet on
the ground and make it relevant.</p>

<h2 id="a-long-quote">A long quote</h2>

<p>Mr. Chalk states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I spent a couple years of my life as a Protestant trying to identify what the Bible really teaches about justification
  and baptism. What I discovered is a proliferation of divergent Protestant opinions that grows—and becomes all the more
  esoteric (and by extension, unclear)—with each generation. I realized that in the end, it was up to me to decide which
  Protestant camp to which I would align myself. Even if I cited trusted pastors, theologians, and biblical scholars,
  <em>I</em> was the one deciding who those trusted authorities would be.</p>

  <p>For those Protestants who still subscribe to <em>sola scriptura</em> (many don’t—another obvious problem), perspicuity has
  proved incapable of determining the Bible’s supposed “plain meaning.” Because they can’t agree on that “plain
  meaning,” they’re forced to make recourse to secondary authorities, but they disagree over which of <em>those</em>
  authorities are trustworthy. This is the reason Protestantism is so thoroughly individualist and subjective: every
  single Protestant can’t help but be his own authority when it comes to divine revelation and its meaning.</p>

  <p>Granted, the earliest Reformers did not intend this. They believed that a corrupted and wicked Catholic Church had
  obscured what was clear. The Reformers’ self-defined mission was simply to get the Bible into the hands of individual
  people so that all persons of faith could divine its clear teachings. It didn’t play out that way—not even in their
  lifetime, as the debate between Luther and Zwingli over the Eucharist at the Marburg Colloquy demonstrated.</p>

  <p>The Bible <em>isn’t</em> clear—at least not in the sense that Protestants claim. More than five hundred years of Protestant
  history should make that obvious. Christians require a different paradigm for interpreting the Bible, one that is
  coherent, that is historically and intellectually defensible, and that drives us to Christ rather than into ourselves.
  And that model exists in the Catholic Church.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="a-quibble-over-authority">A quibble over authority</h2>

<p>His article is about the perspicuity of scripture. But I’d like to zoom in on the question of authority.</p>

<p><em>Who has the authority to decide what you believe</em>?</p>

<p>He said he was trying to flee a particular “problem”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even if I cited trusted pastors, theologians, and biblical scholars, [as a Protestant] <em>I</em> was the one deciding who
  those trusted authorities would be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The author said he was formerly a Protestant. Now he is writing as a Catholic. Logically, one cannot be both Protestant
and Catholic at the same time. So for some amount of time between the two (perhaps a very brief time) he was neither
Protestant nor Catholic. And it was in this time that he decided to be Catholic.</p>

<p>Let me reiterate that: <em>he</em> decided <em>for himself</em> who <em>his</em> <u>individual</u> trusted authority should be. Which is what
he said he didn’t want to do.</p>

<p>So what exactly is his beef with an individual deciding who to trust?</p>

<h3 id="the-knowledge-of-authority">The knowledge of authority</h3>

<p>Let me throw another question out there: how sure is Mr. Chalk about his decision? Does he know this <em>infallibly</em>?
Because if he doesn’t know it infallibly then <em>maybe he’s wrong about the Catholic Church</em>. (Insert scary music here.)</p>

<p>To quote
<a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/online-edition/the-best-argument-for-sola-scriptura">Karlo Broussard’s article</a> (also
on Catholic.com), these are supposedly the ways in which a person can have infallible knowledge of something:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><em>We directly sense something</em>. For example, when I see the tree outside, I have an immediate and direct sense
experience of the tree and thereby infallibly know that the tree exists (a view known as direct realism).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><em>A claim is reduced to a violation of a first principle</em>, like the principle of non-contradiction (PNC)—that is, that
something can’t both be and not be in the same respect at the same place and time. If a claim were to violate the
PNC, we would infallibly know that the claim is false because the PNC cannot be denied without presupposing its
validity. (See my new book The New Relativism: Unmasking the Philosophy of Today’s Woke Moralists.) When a principle
can’t be denied like this, that’s a sure sign it’s true.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><em>A claim about reality that is itself directly confirmed by a miracle (or miracles)</em>. Given that miracles require
divine power, and God can’t confirm falsehood, miraculous confirmation would give us infallible knowledge that the
prophet’s claim is backed by God and thereby true.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><em>A claim is definitively made by someone who has been given authority</em> to speak on behalf of God, either by God
himself or by another whose authority is miraculously confirmed. Even though such a person might not have miraculous
confirmation directly associated with his claim, there is a transfer of divine authority that’s been already
established.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><em>God reveals something to you or me directly</em>.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>For the record, I’m not agreeing with Mr. Broussard. But he sounds like an authority in Catholicism so let’s apply his
approach to one of his fellows. Let’s now consider which of these Mr. Chalk might appeal to for having infallible
knowledge as to the authority of the Catholic church.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Direct sense doesn’t apply here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I struggle to see the connection to first principles. I’m assuming Mr. Chalk didn’t see a connection either.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most Catholics I know aren’t Catholic because they witnessed a miracle. I’m assuming Mr. Chalk didn’t, either.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Someone with authority made a clear claim” sounds relevant. I’ll explore this more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similar to #3, I’m assuming this wasn’t the case for Mr. Chalk.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>But here’s the problem with #4. It’s question begging. Try this sentence on for size: “Mr. Chalk knows the Catholic
Church is authoritative because it said so, and Mr. Chalk knows the Catholic Church is authoritative”. To make the
question begging more clear, I’ll put that into a syllogism:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Mr. Chalk knows the Catholic Church has authority</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Catholic Church said it has authority</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, Mr. Chalk knows the Catholic Church has authority</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There’s nothing in the conclusion that is not already stated in a premise. Classic question begging.</p>

<p>And question begging is a violation of a first principle. Therefore, if the above is how a person arrives at infallible
knowledge, then I know infallibly that Mr. Chalk does <em>not</em> have infallible knowledge about the Catholic Church’s
authority.</p>

<p>I’ll say it again: <em>he</em> decided <em>for himself</em> who <em>his</em> <u>individual</u> trusted authority should be.</p>

<p>So what exactly is his beef with an individual deciding who to trust (even though he did it himself)?</p>

<h3 id="fissiparousness">Fissiparousness</h3>

<p>He says it’s an issue of fissiparousness. To quote Mr. Chalk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And that explains the fissiparous five-century history of Protestantism, making every self-identifying Christian into
  his own pope.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But how does Mr. Chalk know <em>infallibly</em> that fissiparousness doesn’t exist within his own walls of paradise? Because
the Catholic Church says so? But we’ve already established that Mr. Chalk doesn’t <em>really</em> know that the Catholic Church
is right, at least not with the same level of certainty that he requires Protestants to have of everything in scripture.</p>

<p>And we all know division has haunted even the Catholic Church. And even to this day.</p>

<p>So why does any of this even matter? Am I wasting my time writing this? Is this just a pointless argument? Are you
wasting your time reading it?</p>

<h2 id="where-it-actually-matters">Where it actually matters</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’d like to make a controversial claim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So would I:</p>

<p><i>You can be forgiven of all your sins, past present and future. You can gain the inheritance of the saints in light.
You can go directly to heaven when you die (without stopping in purgatory). All you have to do is ask Jesus to forgive
you and trust that he has.</i></p>

<p>You won’t need a priest to absolve you. This can happen right now in the privacy of your own home.</p>

<p>You won’t need to wonder if you are in God’s grace. Your faith will produce undeniable fruit proving that you are.</p>

<p>You won’t need a weekly dose of sacraments to top up your splashing and spilling jar of grace. Your righteousness will
be firmly seated in heaven at the right hand of the Father.</p>

<p>By what authority do I make these claims? By God’s authority. Because these things are clear in scripture, which is
God’s word.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all: yet those things which are
  necessary to be known, believed, and observed for salvation are so clearly propounded, and opened in some place of
  Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto
  a sufficient understanding of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do I know this <em>infallibly</em>? No of course not, but I’m certain enough to act on it. You should act on it, too.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="christian" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Interacting with a Catholic notion of authority as it touches on the Bible]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Sufficiency of Scripture</title><link href="/christian/2023/08/05/sufficiency-of-scripture.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Sufficiency of Scripture" /><published>2023-08-05T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-08-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/christian/2023/08/05/sufficiency-of-scripture</id><content type="html" xml:base="/christian/2023/08/05/sufficiency-of-scripture.html"><![CDATA[<p>Matthew Barrett <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/essay/the-sufficiency-of-scripture/">wrote an essay on TGC</a> titled
“The Sufficiency of Scripture”.</p>

<h2 id="summary-of-the-article">Summary of the article</h2>

<p>Here is the definition and summary given by Barrett:</p>

<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scripture is sufficient in that it is the only inspired, inerrant, and therefore final authority for Christians for
  faith and godliness, with all other authorities being subservient to Scripture.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sufficiency of Scripture is a doctrine challenged on multiple fronts. Ever since the Reformation, Rome challenged
  Scripture’s sufficiency in claiming that an infallible tradition and papal magisterium was necessary to provide the
  correct interpretation of Scripture. In response, the Reformers asserted that Scripture is a sufficient authority for
  all things pertaining to faith and godliness, not needing to appeal to another authority. However, this does not mean
  that Scripture functions alone apart from any other source or authority; rather, all other authorities serve under
  Scripture, while Scripture rules over them as the final and inspired authority from God.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="study-guide-answers">Study guide answers</h2>

<p>These are my answers to a study guide given by my pastor.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Does the sufficiency of Scripture mean we don’t need or shouldn’t use any other confessions, books, or sources in
our studies? Why or why not? Does the sufficiency of Scripture mean that it is the only authority? If not, what is
the relationship between Scripture and other authorities?
    <blockquote>
      <p>No, Barrett states</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>With that in mind, the Christian need not fear the use of extrabiblical sources. In fact, the Christian should
    have no hesitancy learning from, appealing to, and utilizing extrabiblical sources.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Barrett contrasts <em>sola scriptura</em> with <em>nuda scriptura</em>, the view that scripture is the <em>only</em> rule of faith to
  the exclusion of all other
  sources<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuda_scriptura#:~:text=the%20view%20that%20scripture%20is%20the%20only%20rule%20of%20faith%20to%20the%20exclusion%20of%20all%20other%20sources">*</a>. Evidently that view was found among the Anabaptists and radical reformers, and appears in modern day Fundamentalism. It appears that <em>nuda scriptura</em> is appealing to people who wish to
  emphasize the role of the Bible in daily life. However, it can lead to confusion about what exactly another
  “authority” or “tradition” might be. For example one might think that just because one’s church does not belong to
  a denomination, that church is therefore free from the theological influence of tradition. And this can lead
  people to elevate the position and authority of traditions within that individual church. Because if people think
  everything that church does and believes arises from the Bible and from the Bible alone, then things which are in
  fact mere tradition and artifacts of history begin to capture people’s consciences.</p>

      <p><em>Sola scriptura</em>, on the other hand, explicitly allows room for other authorities to function with scripture. But
  in a way that they serve and are corrected by scripture. The Apostles’ Creed, for example, is a wonderful
  distillation of truths arising from scripture. And it is also true that the Apostles’ Creed is not immune to
  critical thinking by interpreters of scripture—for example, what does it mean that “Christ descended into
  hell [and arose three days later]” when he promised the repentant thief “today you will be with me in paradise”
  Luke 23:43 (and arose three days later)? <em>Sola scriptura</em> empowers you to answer that question from scripture with
  a free conscience.</p>

      <p>I also find it helpful to think about the role of
  <a href="/christian/2023/08/02/scripture-as-divine-revelation.html">General Revelation</a> in relation to Special
  Revelation. Both are revelation from God. And if Special Revelation is true because God is true, then General
  Revelation is also just as true. Therefore, General Revelation is infallible. Therefore it’s legitimate to reason
  and draw conclusions from General Revelation, just as we do from scripture. However, we ought to be careful by
  remembering that General Revelation is less specific than scripture in many matters. And so we ought to reject any
  conclusions drawn from General Revelation that contradict necessary deductions from scripture. For example, even
  though a large body of science claims that the earth is many billions of years old, the Christian is more than
  free to reject that inference on the grounds of good and necessary deductions from scripture. And at the same time
  even people without access to the bible are obligated to believe that there is an eternal uncreated being—if
  anything exists and is an effect then by deduction there is an Uncaused Cause, and everyone knows that they their
  self exist, and only exist contingently. And so we see that good and necessary deductions can be drawn from sources
  other than scripture and can rightly bind people’s consciences, and scripture stands supreme.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What is the difference between the Roman Catholic view of Scripture’s sufficiency and the view of the Reformers?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Barrett says:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Rome challenged Scripture’s sufficiency, claiming that an infallible tradition and papal magisterium is also
    needed to provide the one, true interpretation of Scripture. This conclusion stems from their assumption that
    tradition is a second infallible source or conduit of divine revelation.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The Catechism of the Catholic Church states,
  <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PK.HTM">beginning in paragraph 75</a>, the following things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Christ commanded the Apostles to preach the Gospel</li>
        <li>The Gospel was handed on in two ways: orally (leading to Sacred Tradition), and in writing (as Sacred Scripture
  and in later writings contributing to Sacred
  Tradition)<a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PK.HTM#:~:text=handed%20on%20in%20two%20ways">*</a></li>
        <li>The authority to preach the Gospel was passed along through generations of bishops as successors to the
  Apostles<a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PK.HTM#:~:text=bishops%20as%20their%20successors">*</a></li>
        <li>Both of these avenues of teaching preserve and perpetuate the Gospel and together are a “living transmission”
  called Sacred
  Tradition<a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PK.HTM#:~:text=78%20This-,living%20transmission,-%2C%20accomplished%20in%20the">*</a></li>
        <li>Both Scripture and Tradition are compatible, bound closely together, and inform one another in a dynamic flowing
  way<a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PL.HTM#:~:text=bound%20closely%20together">*</a></li>
        <li>Both Scripture and Tradition must be accepted and honored with equal sentiments of devotion and
  reverence<a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PL.HTM#:~:text=Both%20Scripture%20and%20Tradition%20must%20be%20accepted%20and%20honoured%20with%20equal%20sentiments%20of%20devotion%20and%20reverence">*</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p><br />
The Catholic Church finds the ability for herself to keep Scripture and Tradition in sync. In the above section of
  the Catechism she claims the help of the Holy Spirit. Additionally,
  <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PM.HTM#:~:text=The%20task%20of,Bishop%20of%20Rome.">paragraph 85</a>
  says:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The task of giving an authentic interpretation of the Word of God, whether in its written form or in the form of
    Tradition, has been entrusted to the living teaching office of the Church alone. Its authority in this matter is
    exercised in the name of Jesus Christ. This means that the task of interpretation has been entrusted to the
    bishops in communion with the successor of Peter, the Bishop of Rome.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p><br />
One could easily imagine that over time any teaching not committed to writing for preservation would tend to be
  corrupted and then lost, and any later doctrines built on such a foundation would be suspect. In Jesus’ day the
  Pharisees had so elevated their own tradition (which became corrupt over time) that it rose in practice to the
  position of supreme authority because it was their lens for authoritatively interpreting scripture, resulting in
  their own damnation (Matthew 23). And so Rome is correct to identify that it is dangerous to depart from scripture.
  The Catholic Church seeks shelter by appealing to two things: the Holy Spirit who keeps the Church from corruption;
  and to the inherited ability to tell people what the bible <em>really</em> says.</p>

      <p>Logically, with these safeguards in place there would be no possibility for Sacred Tradition to contradict Sacred
  Scripture in the eyes of lay people. Lay people are not allowed to understand Sacred Scripture in any other way
  than is delivered to them by the Church. Similarly, the teachers of the lay people are not allowed to teach
  anything from Sacred Scripture except what accords with their current understanding of Sacred Tradition. Instead,
  those teachers are excommunicated who contradict teachings of the Church.</p>

      <p>To assert these things as true, however, is question begging. How can a person know that the Catholic Church
  actually possesses the authority to infallibly interpret scripture? You have to accept the conclusion in order to
  believe the premise.</p>

      <p>And it’s my opinion that the Catholic Church has tied herself up in knots trying to maintain this over the
  centuries.</p>

      <p>The view of the Reformers stands in stark contrast. The Reformers recognized that God’s word has no equal, and
  that the bible is God’s word while other streams of teaching are not, even though other streams of teaching do
  often overlap significantly with the bible. Scripture alone bears the privilege of making people wise for salvation; other streams of gospel teaching are only profitable inasmuch as they align with scripture.</p>

      <p>Consequences of <em>sola scriptura</em> include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The ability for lay people to recognize mere traditions of men</li>
        <li>The ability for anyone to be freed from the burden they impose</li>
        <li>The ability to rest in Christ and simply trust him, knowing that no other means of salvation will arise in the
  future, and nothing else will ever be required for our justification</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What are two ways that modern Christians deny the sufficiency of Scripture, if not with their words, with their
actions?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Modern Christians can learn something from the Reformation with regard to <em>sola scriptura</em>. Barrett gives these
  examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Personal experience ought not act as a sieve which sifts scripture</li>
        <li>Pragmatism and sensitivity to the culture’s felt needs ought to yield to scripture
          <ul>
            <li>Scripture ought to be front and center in all songs and sermons</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><br />
This makes me think of how people tend to judge the continuation of certain Spiritual Gifts. On the one hand some
  will point to personal experience and say “I’ve seen them in action”, and that is the reason they believe it. This
  fails to let scripture judge the situation. But on the other hand some will construct an elaborate argument from
  scripture for why they cannot possibly be happening today, and the argument is full of statements like “and
  wouldn’t it make sense if …”, yet they seek to bind people’s consciences with this conclusion. This elevates a
  tradition of man insofar as such conclusions are <em>not</em> necessary conclusions from scripture. I’m not prepared to
  engage the issue much deeper than that, but it comes to mind.</p>

      <p>This also reminds me of how contemporary music tends to be introduced into churches. I engaged a little bit with
  this in
  <a href="/christian/2021/08/30/critique-josh-hunt.html">Introducing Contemporary Worship Into a Traditional Church</a>.
  I think that very often the motivation is to find a form of worship in church that appeals to the culture outside
  the church. But we really don’t have to worry too much about what appeals to the outside culture. Instead we need
  to just honor God with our worship, and let the culture think whatever they want about us. If we seem backward to
  the culture but God is pleased then who cares?</p>

<p>Matthew Barrett <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/essay/authority-inerrancy-scripture/">wrote an essay on TGC</a> titled
“The Authority and Inerrancy of Scripture”.</p>

<h2 id="summary-of-the-article">Summary of the article</h2>

<p>Here is the definition and summary given by Barrett:</p>

<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The doctrine of the authority and inerrancy of Scripture is that, as a corollary of the inspiration of Scripture, the
  God-breathed Scriptures are wholly true in all things that they assert in the original autographs and therefore
  function with the authority of God’s own words.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The doctrine of the authority and inerrancy of Scripture is rooted in the doctrine of God; as God is true and
  trustworthy, so is his word recorded in the original autographs of Scriptures. This means that all things that the
  Scriptures assert are wholly true, both in the Old Testament, the Scriptures of Jesus and the apostles, and in the New
  Testament, the writings of the apostles. So far as the original autographs have been faithfully copied, translated,
  and passed down, Scripture is inerrant in its copies. This inerrancy means that all things that the Scriptures assert
  function with the authority of God’s own Word for Christians.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="study-guide-answers">Study guide answers</h2>

<p>These are my answers to a study guide given by my pastor. Hopefully my answers correctly summarize the essay.</p>

<ol>
  <li>When we say Scripture is inerrant, what are we speaking about?
    <ol>
      <li>All ancient manuscripts</li>
      <li>All modern translations</li>
      <li>All the original autographs (i.e., what Moses, Paul, or other authors actually wrote)</li>
      <li>Scripture is inerrant in its message of faith
        <blockquote>
          <p>By saying that Scripture is inerrant we mean that all things <em>in the original autographs</em> are wholly true.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>How does the Doctrine of Inerrancy and Authority follow from our Doctrine of God? This one is for Matt since it can
be expressed in a syllogism. 😊
    <blockquote>
      <p>These syllogisms express the doctrine of the inerrancy of scripture and apply it to modern translations:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>God is true.</li>
        <li>Someone’s word reflects their own truthfulness.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Therefore God’s word is true.</p>
        </li>
        <li>God’s word is true.</li>
        <li>The original autographs were God’s word.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Therefore the original autographs were true.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Truthfulness is preserved in proportion to the faithfulness of a copy and translation.</li>

      <p><br />
An identical form of argument can be constructed to do the same with regard to the authority of scripture:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>God has the highest authority.</li>
        <li>Someone’s word carries their own authority.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Therefore God’s word has the highest authority.</p>
        </li>
        <li>God’s word has the highest authority.</li>
        <li>The original autographs were God’s word.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Therefore the original autographs had the highest authority.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Authority is preserved in proportion to the faithfulness of a copy and translation.</li>
        <li>Most bibles we have today faithfully copy and translate the original autographs.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Therefore most bibles we have today are nearly as authoritative as the original autographs.</p>

  <li>Is the doctrine of Scripture important? Why? What does B. B. Warfield say?
    <blockquote>
      <p>B. B. Warfield said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The trustworthiness of the Scriptures lies at the foundation of trust in the Christian system of doctrine, and
    is therefore fundamental to the Christian hope and life.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>By that he means that our trust in the preacher of God’s word hinges on our trust of what he is preaching, and our
obligation to it hinges on the authority of the source he is expositing. In this way, faith and practice both
depend on the doctrine of scripture.</p>

      <p>There is another reason this doctrine is important. Our beliefs about scripture influence and are founded on our
beliefs about God. If we believe that the scriptures are not truthful or authoritative, then we necessarily must
believe that God is neither truthful nor authoritative. And we ought not want to ascribe false things to God.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Does the human authorship of Scripture undermine the doctrine of inerrancy? Why or why not?
    <blockquote>
      <p>While at first blush the human authorship of scripture might seem to undermine the doctrine of inerrancy, in fact
  it does not. Instead, we recognize that humans are only the <em>secondary</em> author of scripture and God is the
  <em>primary</em> author. Since God is the primary author his own personal attributes are reflected and preserved in his
  word, as the syllogisms above demonstrate.</p>

      <p>It can be helpful to think in terms of the communicability of an attribute of God. Certain attributes of God, such
  as his self-existence, cannot be transferred to other things. But certain other attributes of God, such as
  truthfulness, may indeed be transferred to other things. And human authors “carried along by the Holy Spirit”
  would not have inhibited God in this process. Instead they were part of the means and mechanism by which God
  transferred his truthfulness to scripture.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>How would you describe Jesus’ view of the Scriptures? Why does this matter?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Jesus esteemed the scriptures very highly. He always treated the Old Testament with utter trust and reverence. This
  can be seen by his numerous references to and usages of it. For example:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is
    accomplished—Matthew 5:18</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Scripture cannot be broken—John 10:35</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Jesus also made scripture the bedrock of many of his responses and much of his reasoning. Just skim through the New
Testament to see how often Jesus said “have you not read” and “it is written”. Jesus’s success against the devil’s
temptations saliently highlights how much Jesus lived by God’s word.</p>

      <p>Jesus brings a unique credibility to the question of the scriptures. In him himself God’s word has proven true, and
he himself holds God’s word in very high esteem. Therefore, inasmuch as we trust these things about Jesus, our
trust in God’s word may be bolstered.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>The word “plenary” means unqualified and absolute. Barrett says, “Just as inspiration is both verbal and plenary, so
too is inerrancy.” What view does he describe that rejects plenary inspiration? How should we respond to this
approach?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Barrett describes a limited inerrancy view which rejects plenary inspiration. People who hold this view believe
  that scripture is only inerrant with regard to its message of faith. But with regard to other matters (for example
  matters that overlap with modern scientific investigation) they leave room for other authorities (for example
  modern scientific inquiry) to be a higher arbiter of truth.</p>

      <p>This limited inerrancy view undermines the doctrine of
  <a href="https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/understanding-sola-scriptura"><em>sola scriptura</em></a>, which states that God’s
  word is the final authority and ultimate standard for all of life.</p>

      <p>This limited view is also either self-defeating or else leads to a pitiable state. Who decides what a “matter of
  faith” is? Is the statement “Jesus rose from the dead” a matter of faith, or is it a matter of history? Those who
  hold the view of limited inerrancy are forced to say it has no overlap with and is unknowable by historical
  inquiry. Yet historical inquiry is at the very heart of true Christian thought (1 Corinthians 15). And therein lies
  the fault in the limited view. If historical inquiry trumps this matter of faith, then secular historians might
  very well conclude (rightly or wrongly—who’s to say if God’s word isn’t the judge?) that Jesus never rose
  from the dead, and so the Christian who holds this view “is of all people most to be pitied” (1 Corinthians 15:19).
  On the other hand if scripture trumps secular historical inquiry, then it is not true that scripture is inerrant
  <em>only</em> with regard to matters of faith, and the view is self-defeating.</p>

      <p>Therefore we ought to reject the limited view of inerrancy.</p>

<p>Matthew Barrett <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/essay/scripture-divine-revelation/">wrote an essay on TGC</a> titled
“Scripture as Divine Revelation”.</p>

<h2 id="summary-of-the-article">Summary of the article</h2>

<p>Here is the definition and summary given by Barrett:</p>

<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scripture is the written form of God’s special revelation for his people, both the Old Testament and the New
  Testament, which provides them with an enduring, permanent witness through which the Spirit brings them into union
  with the resurrected and ascended Christ.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Divine revelation, which is a remarkable and gracious gift of God, comes in both general and special ways. General
  revelation is given to everyone everywhere is broad (though far from empty) in what it says about God. This kind of
  divine revelation is found in creation and in every person’s conscience. Special revelation, on the other hand, is
  specific in its content and omnipotent in its effect. Through this revelation, God communicates the mysteries of the
  faith and personal knowledge of Christ to his people. Scripture is the written form of special revelation, providing
  God’s people with an enduring witness to the work of God in Christ. This Scripture has been “breathed out” by God
  through his Spirit, carrying along the authors of Scripture as they wrote.</p>

<h2 id="study-guide-answers">Study guide answers</h2>

<p>These are my answers to a study guide given by my pastor. Hopefully my answers correctly summarize the essay.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Barrett gives a definition of Scripture that includes several elements. Identify these elements by answering the
following questions:
    <ol>
      <li>What is Scripture?
        <blockquote>
          <p>Scripture is the written form of God’s special revelation.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>What kind of revelation is Scripture?
        <blockquote>
          <p>It is <em>special</em> revelation, in contrast to <em>general</em> revelation.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>Who is Scripture from?
        <blockquote>
          <p>Scripture is from God.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>Who is Scripture for?
        <blockquote>
          <p>Scripture is for God’s people.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>What is included in Scripture?
        <blockquote>
          <p>Scripture includes the Old and New Testaments. It includes God’s self-revelation. It includes the mysteries of
  the faith, and personal knowledge of Christ. It includes an enduring witness to the work of God in Christ.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>Is Scripture temporary?
        <blockquote>
          <p>No, scripture is an <em>enduring</em> witness.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>What does the Holy Spirit accomplish through Scripture?
        <blockquote>
          <p>The Holy Spirit accomplishes the revelation of the Christ through scripture. It is through this witness that the
  Spirit brings God’s people into union with the resurrected and ascended Christ. In other words, the Spirit makes
  Christ known to us in a saving way.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What is general revelation and what are two examples of general revelation?
    <blockquote>
      <p>General revelation is revelation that is available to all and less precise in what it reveals about God. It
  includes the knowledge that God is divine in nature and very powerful.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>How is special revelation different from general revelation?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Special revelation is more specific in its content. Also it is omnipotent in its effect whereas general revelation
  may be suppressed by people. General revelation is also distinct in that it is received through man’s internal
  conscience and through the created order, as opposed to special revelation which God communicated through various
  other mediums.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What are two reasons why it is extraordinary that God has spoken to us?
    <blockquote>
      <p>It is extraordinary that God has spoken to us because he is such an exalted being, higher than us brittle
  creatures, and utterly impossible to comprehend fully. And also because he is so very holy in contrast to us who
  are so very sinful. It is across these two great gulfs that God has spoken a gracious, redeeming word.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What does general revelation reveal about God? What doesn’t it reveal about God?
    <blockquote>
      <p>General revelation reveals that God is creator. It also reveals many of his divine attributes. However it does not
  reveal the Trinity or the person and work of Christ.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>There are different forms of special revelation. For example, God communicated through prophets, visions, and dreams
in the Old Testament. How is Scripture different from these forms of special revelation?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Scripture is different from other mediums of special revelation in that the witness in scripture is enduring and
  permanent. Prophets died and many of their visions and dreams were not recorded in scripture and thus have been
  lost. Even Christ, who is himself the message and supreme self-revelation of God, ascended into the heavens and in
  that sense is not with us any longer. Scripture, on the other hand, is the Spirit’s enduring, ever-present gift to
  God’s people. We do not know Christ apart from the word of Christ inscripturated.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>True or false. God revealed his written word progressively over time.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Yes, God revealed his written word progressively over time. In Barrett’s words, “[it] did not fall from heaven
  all at once. Rather it was revealed progressively over the course of history and through human hands.”</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>True or false. God revealed his word to every prophet in the same way that he revealed it to Moses on Mount Sinai.
    <blockquote>
      <p>No, not all later prophets had to ascend Sinai like Moses to bring down God’s written word.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What does “inspiration” mean?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Inspiration is key for understanding the scriptures. It does not indicate that the human authors merely recorded
  their religious experience by “inspiring” events. Instead, all scripture is <em>breathed out</em> by God, meaning they
  originated with God.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What did B. B. Warfield mean by the word “concursus”?
    <blockquote>
      <p>He intended to summarize 2 Peter 1:21 which states that men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy
  Spirit. By “concursus” he meant that there was a simultaneous operation between the human and the divine author,
  though the divine author is primary.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What is the greatest testimony to the inspiration of Scripture?
    <blockquote>
      <p>The greatest testimony to the inspiration and divine origin of scripture is the very common refrain in the
  scriptures that Jesus fulfills the covenant promises of God in them.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="personal-reflection">Personal reflection</h2>

<p>This is a helpful reminder that the first cause of scripture was not God’s people. And therefore the organization of
God’s people (“the Church”) was not the first cause. Therefore we do not need to import or appeal to any other authority
than that of God himself.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="christian" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Answers to a study guide on an essay by Matthew Barrett]]></summary></entry></feed>
