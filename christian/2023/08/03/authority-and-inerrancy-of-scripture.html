<p>Matthew Barrett <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/essay/authority-inerrancy-scripture/">wrote an essay on TGC</a> titled
‚ÄúThe Authority and Inerrancy of Scripture‚Äù.</p>

<h2 id="summary-of-the-article">Summary of the article</h2>

<p>Here is the definition and summary given by Barrett:</p>

<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The doctrine of the authority and inerrancy of Scripture is that, as a corollary of the inspiration of Scripture, the
  God-breathed Scriptures are wholly true in all things that they assert in the original autographs and therefore
  function with the authority of God‚Äôs own words.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The doctrine of the authority and inerrancy of Scripture is rooted in the doctrine of God; as God is true and
  trustworthy, so is his word recorded in the original autographs of Scriptures. This means that all things that the
  Scriptures assert are wholly true, both in the Old Testament, the Scriptures of Jesus and the apostles, and in the New
  Testament, the writings of the apostles. So far as the original autographs have been faithfully copied, translated,
  and passed down, Scripture is inerrant in its copies. This inerrancy means that all things that the Scriptures assert
  function with the authority of God‚Äôs own Word for Christians.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="study-guide-answers">Study guide answers</h2>

<p>These are my answers to a study guide given by my pastor. Hopefully my answers correctly summarize the essay.</p>

<ol>
  <li>When we say Scripture is inerrant, what are we speaking about?
    <ol>
      <li>All ancient manuscripts</li>
      <li>All modern translations</li>
      <li>All the original autographs (i.e., what Moses, Paul, or other authors actually wrote)</li>
      <li>Scripture is inerrant in its message of faith
        <blockquote>
          <p>By saying that Scripture is inerrant we mean that all things <em>in the original autographs</em> are wholly true.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>How does the Doctrine of Inerrancy and Authority follow from our Doctrine of God? This one is for Matt since it can
be expressed in a syllogism. üòä
    <blockquote>
      <p>These syllogisms express the doctrine of the inerrancy of scripture and apply it to modern translations:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>God is true.</li>
        <li>Someone‚Äôs word reflects their own truthfulness.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Therefore God‚Äôs word is true.</p>
        </li>
        <li>God‚Äôs word is true.</li>
        <li>The original autographs were God‚Äôs word.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Therefore the original autographs were true.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Truthfulness is preserved in proportion to the faithfulness of a copy and translation.</li>
        <li>Most bibles we have today faithfully copy and translate the original autographs.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Therefore most bibles we have today are nearly as true as the original autographs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The original autographs were true.</li>
        <li>Most bibles we have today are nearly as true as the original autographs.</li>
        <li>Therefore most bibles we have today are very true.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><br />
An identical form of argument can be constructed to do the same with regard to the authority of scripture:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>God has the highest authority.</li>
        <li>Someone‚Äôs word carries their own authority.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Therefore God‚Äôs word has the highest authority.</p>
        </li>
        <li>God‚Äôs word has the highest authority.</li>
        <li>The original autographs were God‚Äôs word.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Therefore the original autographs had the highest authority.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Authority is preserved in proportion to the faithfulness of a copy and translation.</li>
        <li>Most bibles we have today faithfully copy and translate the original autographs.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Therefore most bibles we have today are nearly as authoritative as the original autographs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The original autographs had the highest authority.</li>
        <li>Most bibles we have today are nearly as authoritative as the original autographs.</li>
        <li>Therefore most bibles we have today are very authoritative.</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Is the doctrine of Scripture important? Why? What does B. B. Warfield say?
    <blockquote>
      <p>B. B. Warfield said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The trustworthiness of the Scriptures lies at the foundation of trust in the Christian system of doctrine, and
    is therefore fundamental to the Christian hope and life.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>By that he means that our trust in the preacher of God‚Äôs word hinges on our trust of what he is preaching, and our
obligation to it hinges on the authority of the source he is expositing. In this way, faith and practice both
depend on the doctrine of scripture.</p>

      <p>There is another reason this doctrine is important. Our beliefs about scripture influence and are founded on our
beliefs about God. If we believe that the scriptures are not truthful or authoritative, then we necessarily must
believe that God is neither truthful nor authoritative. And we ought not want to ascribe false things to God.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Does the human authorship of Scripture undermine the doctrine of inerrancy? Why or why not?
    <blockquote>
      <p>While at first blush the human authorship of scripture might seem to undermine the doctrine of inerrancy, in fact
  it does not. Instead, we recognize that humans are only the <em>secondary</em> author of scripture and God is the
  <em>primary</em> author. Since God is the primary author his own personal attributes are reflected and preserved in his
  word, as the syllogisms above demonstrate.</p>

      <p>It can be helpful to think in terms of the communicability of an attribute of God. Certain attributes of God, such
  as his self-existence, cannot be transferred to other things. But certain other attributes of God, such as
  truthfulness, may indeed be transferred to other things. And human authors ‚Äúcarried along by the Holy Spirit‚Äù
  would not have inhibited God in this process. Instead they were part of the means and mechanism by which God
  transferred his truthfulness to scripture.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>How would you describe Jesus‚Äô view of the Scriptures? Why does this matter?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Jesus esteemed the scriptures very highly. He always treated the Old Testament with utter trust and reverence. This
  can be seen by his numerous references to and usages of it. For example:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is
    accomplished‚ÄîMatthew 5:18</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Scripture cannot be broken‚ÄîJohn 10:35</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Jesus also made scripture the bedrock of many of his responses and much of his reasoning. Just skim through the New
Testament to see how often Jesus said ‚Äúhave you not read‚Äù and ‚Äúit is written‚Äù. Jesus‚Äôs success against the devil‚Äôs
temptations saliently highlights how much Jesus lived by God‚Äôs word.</p>

      <p>Jesus brings a unique credibility to the question of the scriptures. In him himself God‚Äôs word has proven true, and
he himself holds God‚Äôs word in very high esteem. Therefore, inasmuch as we trust these things about Jesus, our
trust in God‚Äôs word may be bolstered.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>The word ‚Äúplenary‚Äù means unqualified and absolute. Barrett says, ‚ÄúJust as inspiration is both verbal and plenary, so
too is inerrancy.‚Äù What view does he describe that rejects plenary inspiration? How should we respond to this
approach?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Barrett describes a limited inerrancy view which rejects plenary inspiration. People who hold this view believe
  that scripture is only inerrant with regard to its message of faith. But with regard to other matters (for example
  matters that overlap with modern scientific investigation) they leave room for other authorities (for example
  modern scientific inquiry) to be a higher arbiter of truth.</p>

      <p>This limited inerrancy view undermines the doctrine of
  <a href="https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/understanding-sola-scriptura"><em>sola scriptura</em></a>, which states that God‚Äôs
  word is the final authority and ultimate standard for all of life.</p>

      <p>This limited view is also either self-defeating or else leads to a pitiable state. Who decides what a ‚Äúmatter of
  faith‚Äù is? Is the statement ‚ÄúJesus rose from the dead‚Äù a matter of faith, or is it a matter of history? Those who
  hold the view of limited inerrancy are forced to say it has no overlap with and is unknowable by historical
  inquiry. Yet historical inquiry is at the very heart of true Christian thought (1 Corinthians 15). And therein lies
  the fault in the limited view. If historical inquiry trumps this matter of faith, then secular historians might
  very well conclude (rightly or wrongly‚Äîwho‚Äôs to say if God‚Äôs word isn‚Äôt the judge?) that Jesus never rose
  from the dead, and so the Christian who holds this view ‚Äúis of all people most to be pitied‚Äù (1 Corinthians 15:19).
  On the other hand if scripture trumps secular historical inquiry, then it is not true that scripture is inerrant
  <em>only</em> with regard to matters of faith, and the view is self-defeating.</p>

      <p>Therefore we ought to reject the limited view of inerrancy.</p>
