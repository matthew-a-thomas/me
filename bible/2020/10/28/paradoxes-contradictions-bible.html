          <p><i>October 28, 2020&mdash;A look at paradoxes, contradictions, and the Bible (<a href="/categories/bible">bible</a>)</i></p>
          
          


          <p>A contradiction is when two mutually exclusive things are both said to be true
at the same time in the same sense. For example, it’s a contradiction to say
“this spot on the ball is red and not blue” and “the same spot
on the ball is blue and not red” about the same spot on the same ball at
the same time in the same way. They are mutually exclusive statements and
there’s a contradiction.</p>

<p>Contradictions are very useful. You can make
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction#Examples" target="_blank">proofs by contradiction</a>.
You can also find contradictions within the framework of certain philosophies
which prove them to be wrong. Contradictions are very powerful things.</p>

<p>A paradox is when there appears to be a contradiction but in fact there isn’t
<em>necessarily</em> one. For example, it is paradoxical for one person to say
“the ball is red” and another person to say “the ball is
blue” about the same ball at the same time. But perhaps the ball is
painted white and the one person is shining a red light on it from one side
while the other person is shining a blue light on it from the other side. The
one person said it was red <em>in a sense</em> while the other person said it was blue
<em>in a different sense</em>.</p>

<p>Paradoxes aren’t very strong. A paradox might leave you feeling uneasy that you
don’t understand something, but that’s all.</p>

<p>Notice how I proved that the paradox wasn’t a contradiction. All I had to do was
give a single possible explanation of how the paradox could be resolved. It
wasn’t necessary for me to prove that the possible explanation was real. It’s
much easier than that. All I had to do was give a <em>possible</em> explanation.</p>

<p>So contradictions can be difficult to establish, and it is often easy to knock
supposed contradictions down to mere paradoxes.</p>

<h2 id="in-the-bible">In the Bible</h2>

<p>Many people claim to have found many contradictions in the Bible. That often
leads to discussing the reliability of the Bible. But I haven’t come across one
yet that really is a contradiction. I’m not bragging (I want to trust in Jesus
alone, not in my own confidence). Instead I have found that what many are
calling contradictions are only paradoxes.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Peter denied Jesus once before and twice after the rooster crowed
<a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Mark 14:30" target="_blank">Mark 14:30</a>;
<a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Mark 14:66-72" target="_blank">Mark 14:66-72</a>.
Peter denied Jesus three times before the rooster crowed
<a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Luke 22:34" target="_blank">Luke 22:34</a>;
<a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Luke 22:54-62" target="_blank">Luke 22:54-62</a></li>
  <li>There is only one God <a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Deuteronomy 6:4" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>;
<a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Isaiah 44:6" target="_blank">Isaiah 44:6</a>.
Jesus is God <a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=John 1:1" target="_blank">John 1:1</a>. The Holy Spirit is
God <a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Acts 5:3-4" target="_blank">Acts 5:3-4</a>. The Father is God
<a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Philippians 1:2" target="_blank">Philippians 1:2</a>. Jesus is not the Holy
Spirit <a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Matthew 3:16" target="_blank">Matthew 3:16</a>. Jesus is not the Father
<a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Matthew 3:17" target="_blank">Matthew 3:17</a>. The Holy Spirit is not the
Father <a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=John 14:26" target="_blank">John 14:26</a></li>
  <li>Jesus said his contemporary generation would not pass away until He came
again <a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Matthew 24:30-34" target="_blank">Matthew 24:30-34</a></li>
</ol>

<p>But these are only paradoxes. Here are some possible explanations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Perhaps “when the rooster crows” is an idiom that meant different
things to the different original audiences. Each of the gospels were written
to different audiences. Therefore it’s possible that the gospel writers used
an idiom in a peculiar way familiar to their audience, similar to
<a href="https://apologeticspress.org/apcontent.aspx?category=6&amp;article=759#ctl00_cphPage_BblQuesContent_lblContentAuthors:~:text=A%20family%20of%20three%20went%20to,claim%20that%20Ricky%20had%20contradicted%20himself." target="_blank">this idea</a></li>
  <li>Perhaps there is a single divine being and three distinct divine persons.
That would mean that God is one in a different way than He is three.
Therefore it is possible that God can be one (in a sense) at the same time He
is three (in another sense)</li>
  <li>Perhaps Jesus figuratively returned in judgment in 70 A.D. by sending the
Roman armies that sacked Jerusalem</li>
</ol>

<p>Don’t be quick to think you’ve found a contradiction in the Bible. You probably
only have a paradox.</p>
