          <p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cosmology+definition">Google says</a> that
“cosmology” is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>noun</em></p>

  <p>the science of the origin and development of the universe. Modern astronomy is
  dominated by the Big Bang theory, which brings together observational
  astronomy and particle physics.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>an account or theory of the origin of the universe.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikipedia has an article titled
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future">Timeline of the far future</a>”.
The article spans an unfathomable stretch of time from the near present all the
way out to \(10^{10^{10^{56}}}\) years in the future. As of this writing it
cites 209 references from a broad range of sources, including many who are
highly regarded by the scientific community. In its own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the future cannot be predicted with certainty, present understanding in
  various scientific fields allows for the prediction of some far-future events,
  if only in the broadest outline. These fields include astrophysics, which
  studies how planets and stars form, interact, and die; particle physics, which
  has revealed how matter behaves at the smallest scales; evolutionary biology,
  which predicts how life will evolve over time; plate tectonics, which shows
  how continents shift over millennia; and sociology, which examines how human
  societies and cultures evolve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article draws on a wide range of people from a wide range of fields.</p>

<p>I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that article presents a sketch of modern
cosmology.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-and-its-impact">The future and its impact</h2>

<p>What does the future hold?</p>

<p>You probably have a good idea of how tomorrow is going to pan out. For most
people it’ll be very unsurprising. You’ll wake up, eat breakfast, go to work,
and so on. Tomorrow you’ll eat lunch because you won’t want to be hungry before
suppertime rolls around.</p>

<p>Later this week or perhaps later this month you’ll have a bill to pay. If you
don’t pay that bill then you’ll be sent to collections. And so you’ll go to
work and will earn your paycheck. And you have other things that you’ll want to
do in the future, so you make plans to spend your paycheck on those things too.</p>

<p>You probably do a great many things because <em>you foresee something in the
future</em>. In a word, future events drive, control, motivate, and govern your
actions now.</p>

<h2 id="the-oughtness-of-the-future">The oughtness of the future</h2>

<p>What ought you do today? It depends a lot on what the future will bring.</p>

<p>Is it going to rain this afternoon? Then you ought to bring an umbrella with you
when you go out.</p>

<p>How many market cycles have you lived through and afterward thought “I
ought to have distributed my investments in a different manner”?</p>

<p>Are you working hard on a large project now because you believe it will be
important in the future? In that case you attribute value to your present work
because you anticipate that the outcome of your work will be valuable in the
future.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-modern-cosmology">The future of modern cosmology</h2>

<p>These are the most distant events anticipated by the Wikipedia article I linked
to above:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Years in the future</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>\(10^{10^{76}}\)</td>
      <td>Beyond this point, it is almost certain that the universe will be an almost pure vacuum, with all baryonic matter having decayed into subatomic particles, until it reaches its final energy state, assuming it does not happen before this time.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\(10^{10^{120}}\)</td>
      <td>Highest estimate for the time it takes for the universe to reach its final energy state.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\(10^{10^{10^{56}}}\)</td>
      <td>Around this vast timeframe, quantum tunnelling in any isolated patch of the universe could generate new inflationary events, resulting in new Big Bangs giving birth to new universes.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>To put it crassly, modern cosmology says everything is going to fizzle away into
nothing.</p>

<p>And then it’ll start over again. These “new inflationary events” aren’t one-off
events; it’s cyclical.</p>

<h2 id="vanity-of-vanities">Vanity of vanities</h2>

<p>Have you ever read Ecclesiastes? Here’s how
<a href="https://www.esv.org/Ecclesiastes+1/">chapter one</a> starts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher,<br />
	  vanity of vanities! All is vanity.<br />
	What does man gain by all the toil<br />
	  at which he toils under the sun?<br />
	A generation goes, and a generation comes,<br />
  but the earth remains forever.<br />
	The sun rises, and the sun goes down,<br />
	  and hastens to the place where it rises.<br />
	The wind blows to the south<br />
	  and goes around to the north;<br />
	around and around goes the wind,<br />
	  and on its circuits the wind returns.<br />
	All streams run to the sea,<br />
	  but the sea is not full;<br />
	to the place where the streams flow,<br />
	  there they flow again.<br />
	All things are full of weariness;<br />
	  a man cannot utter it;<br />
	the eye is not satisfied with seeing,<br />
	  nor the ear filled with hearing.<br />
	What has been is what will be,<br />
	  and what has been done is what will be done,<br />
	  and there is nothing new under the sun.<br />
	Is there a thing of which it is said,<br />
	  “See, this is new”?<br />
	It has been already<br />
	  in the ages before us.<br />
	There is no remembrance of former things,<br />
	  nor will there be any remembrance<br />
	of later things yet to be<br />
	  among those who come after.<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ecclesiastes is basically an apologetic against the worldviews that were
competing against ancient Hebrew thought at that time. Those worldviews thought
that history was cyclical, and Solomon’s book makes it very clear how pointless
such a history would be. On the other hand, history in the eyes of the Hebrew
Bible is linear with a definite beginning and certain goal.</p>

<p>Modern cosmology falls squarely in the sights of Ecclesiastes.</p>

<h2 id="the-vanity-of-modern-cosmology">The vanity of modern cosmology</h2>

<p>Not only are you supposed to believe that nobody will ever remember or care
about anything you do. You’re also supposed to believe that the same thing is
going to happen to someone else somewhere else. Over and over again forever.</p>

<p>Why should you go to work tomorrow? According to modern cosmology your work is
going to fizzle away and be forgotten. And then eventually someone else
somewhere else is going to do whatever you are going to do tomorrow, whether you
do it or not. So why not just stay home?</p>

<p>On the one hand you can get away with whatever you want because nobody is
watching, or if they are their opinion doesn’t really matter in the grand scheme
of things because they’re destined to be just a fizzled out nothing.</p>

<p>But on the other hand there is no glory in anything you do, because you also are
destined to be just a fizzled out nothing.</p>

<p>To put it simply, there is no “oughtness” to modern cosmology.</p>

<h2 id="the-weight-and-consequence-of-biblical-cosmology">The weight and consequence of Biblical cosmology</h2>

<p>In sharp contrast, the Bible is very clear that history has a date of
manufacture. That was a few thousand years ago when God started saying things.</p>

<p>And it is also clear that history is on a very intentional trajectory leading
through a series of intentional events planned and executed by a sovereign and
wise God.</p>

<p>For example, the Day of Judgment is coming when “the heavens will pass away with
a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth
and the works that are done on it will be exposed” (2 Peter 3:10).</p>

<p>There is a God who made you. Therefore you are accountable to him. Furthermore
he has fixed a Day of Judgment and has gone to great lengths to make two things
clear: you are a sinner who is not able to make it through that Day; and there
is a savior who is able to bring you through unscathed.</p>

<p>Not only <em>ought</em> you to go to work (because God said so in 2 Thessalonians
3:6–12)—it’s possible for your work tomorrow to be eternally
significant (because God will reward whatever service is rendered to
him—Ephesians 6:7–8).</p>
