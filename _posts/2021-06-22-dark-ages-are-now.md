description: Nobody will remember what you're doing now

I have emails from as recent as 2011 proving that I went to a few
[LAN parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN_party) with some friends. I have
records of receipts, chat conversations about what PC upgrades we'd be making
for the events, what video games we were going to play. It was good clean fun.

And _I_ know for a fact that it happened. So do they.

But _you_ try searching for
["RAGElan Owensboro"](https://www.google.com/search?q=ragelan+owensboro). What
do you find?

Nothing.

That was only a decade ago. One hundred years from now who is going to know that
it happened?

Nobody.

## The point

If I wanted to make a point I would say spend some time on
[something](https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-18.htm) that is guaranteed to still
be around more than one hundred million years from now. Like the Lord's church.
