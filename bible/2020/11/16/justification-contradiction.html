          <p><i>November 16, 2020&mdash;James vs Paul</i></p>
          
          


          <p>The point of <a href="/bible/2020/10/28/paradoxes-contradictions-bible.html">my previous post</a> was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t be quick to think you’ve found a contradiction in the Bible. You probably only have a paradox.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, then what about Paul versus James?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Romans 3:28" target="_blank">Romans 3:28</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=James 2:24" target="_blank">James 2:24</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So which is it? By faith or by works?</p>

<p>At first blush this seems pretty difficult. The same Greek word for “justified”
was used by both
<a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/romans/3-28.htm" target="_blank">Paul</a>
and
<a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/james/2-24.htm" target="_blank">James</a>.
They’re both using this word.</p>

<h2 id="context-is-king">Context is king</h2>

<p>Remember that a word’s meaning is determined by its context. Take the word
“take” for example.
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=take+definition" target="_blank">According to this Google search</a>,
that word can be used in lots of ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>He leaned forward to <em>take</em> (lay hold of) her hand</li>
  <li>He <em>took</em> (removed from a particular place) an envelope from his inside pocket</li>
  <li>He completed a particularly difficult scene in two <em>takes</em> (scenes)</li>
  <li>The <em>take</em> (an amount gained) from commodity taxation</li>
</ul>

<p>So if I say “I took it” you won’t immediately know whether I mean “I took it
from right under her nose” meaning I stole it, or if I mean “I took it to be
inspected” meaning my car can now be registered with the state. You have to keep
reading to better understand my meaning.</p>

<p>According to BibleHub, the word that both Paul and James use is
<a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/1344.htm" target="_blank">Strong’s Greek #1344 δικαιοῦ</a>. However you pronounce that, it means:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To show to be righteous, declare righteous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I make righteous, defend the cause of, plead for the righteousness (innocence)
  of, acquit, justify; hence: I regard as righteous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So which is it? To show to be righteous, or to declare to be righteous?</p>

<p>It depends on how the word is used.</p>

<h2 id="used-the-same-way">Used the same way?</h2>

<p>There are some interesting things that Paul says about “justification” in the
neighborhood of <a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Romans 3:28" target="_blank">Romans 3:28</a>. I’ll just focus on
<a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Romans 4:2" target="_blank">Romans 4:2</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not
  before God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Allow me to point out a few things from that verse:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If someone is justified by works then they have something to boast about</li>
  <li>No one has anything to boast about before God</li>
  <li>Therefore no one is justified <em>before God</em> by works</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll just quickly acknowledge that the “works” that Paul is talking about are
works of “the Law”, meaning the Mosaic Law. But that includes the Ten
Commandments (<a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Exodus 20" target="_blank">Exodus 20</a>) and the Two Great
Commandments (love the Lord with all your
heart—<a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Deuteronomy 6:5" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; and love your
neighbor as yourself—<a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Leviticus 19:18" target="_blank">Leviticus 19:18</a>). So
don’t go looking for an exception for these “Christian”
commandments—they’re among the “works” that Paul says don’t justify anyone
before God.</p>

<p>There are also some interesting things that James says in the neighborhood of
James 2:24.</p>

<p>Take <a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=James 2:14&mdash;17" target="_blank">James 2:14—17</a> for example (emphasis
mine, of course):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have
  works? Can <strong>that</strong> faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed
  and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be
  warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what
  good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What kind of “faith” is James talking about which is unable to save anyone? He
is talking about “that” faith, a so-called faith unaccompanied by works, a dead
and lifeless thing that even demons have—and shudder!</p>

<p>Then comes <a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=James 2:18" target="_blank">James 2:18</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith
  apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not as clear to me precisely what kind of works James is talking about. But
it doesn’t matter. What’s clear is James throws down the rhetorical gauntlet by
challenging his hypothetical opponent to <em>prove</em> their faith <em>to him</em> using any
other means than demonstrating their works.</p>

<p>Taken together we can see that James is saying:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A living faith is necessarily accompanied by works</li>
  <li><em>People</em> (you and me, not God) cannot distinguish claims of faith without
inspecting the accompanying works</li>
</ul>

<p>He then goes on to list several biblical characters whose claims to faith were
proven genuine through their works. In that sense they were justified by their
works.</p>

<p>James was talking about people demonstrating true living faith and showing
righteousness; Paul was talking about God declaring people to be righteous.</p>

<h2 id="the-point">The point</h2>

<p>Paul and James did not use the word in the same way. There is no contradiction.</p>

<h2 id="the-controversy">The controversy</h2>

<p>A bit of controversy has swarmed around these verses for more than 500 years.</p>

<p>I’ll simply point out that Paul said God declares people to be righteous <em>apart</em>
from their works (of the Law, which includes the Ten Commandments and other
“Christian” things, see above) <a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Romans 4:6" target="_blank">Romans 4:6</a>. And
that God declares people to be righteous who, at the moment of that
declaration, are otherwise ungodly <a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Romans 4:5" target="_blank">Romans 4:5</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re inclined to object to that, please first double-check that you aren’t
just re-raising these 2,000 year old objections:
<a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Romans 6:1" target="_blank">Romans 6:1</a>;
<a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Romans 6:15" target="_blank">Romans 6:15</a>.</p>

<p>God’s declaration of righteousness is a free gift that He gives. He is not
influenced in any way by the person’s personal merit. And He is completely free
and just to declare sinners to be righteous when He credits Jesus’s real
righteousness to them.</p>

<p>And God always follows His declaration of righteousness with the progressive
work of transforming the sinner into a more and more righteous person through
the living, active, working faith that He gives them. Once God starts that work
He will complete it <a href="https://www.esv.org/search/?q=Philippians 1:6" target="_blank">Philippians 1:6</a>.</p>

<p>And the Christian never gets to point to anything about himself.</p>
