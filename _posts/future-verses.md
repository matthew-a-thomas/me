description: "Three common verses"
---

I understand the bible teaches that God is in control of everything. He is
intimately involved in every aspect of everything, from upholding the universe
by the word of His power ({% include verse.html verse="Hebrews 1:3" %}) to
predestining people to salvation
({% include verse.html verse="Romans 8:28&ndash;30" %}) to predestining people
to damnation ({% include verse.html verse="Romans 9:21&ndash;24" %}).

People raise _many_ objections to this. Three verses in particular often rise to
the top when talking specifically about predestination:

* 2 Peter 3:9
* 1 Timothy 2:4
* Ezekiel 18:23

I want you to understand the argument. It goes something like this: the Lord
doesn't want anyone to be lost; the bible says that some people are going to
be judged and go to hell; therefore the Lord's desire isn't accomplished.
Depending on who you talk to they might take it a step further, perhaps saying
that the Lord doesn't predestine people for salvation but it's up to their free
will.

Let's take a look at these verses.

Three verses that often come up in conversations about God's

Ezekiel 18:23

[23] Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord GOD, and not rather that he should turn from his way and live? (ESV)

1 Timothy 2:3â€“4

[3] This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, [4] who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. (ESV)

## 2 Peter 3:9&mdash;it's not who you think

I put this one first because I think it's easiest to deal with.
{% include verse.html verse="2 Peter 3:8&ndash;9" %} says:

> But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a
  thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slow to
  fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, _not
  wishing that any should perish_, but that all should reach repentance.

I italicized the part that people usually refer to. It says "[the Lord is] not
wishing that any should perish".

But let's be clear. The Lord doesn't wish any _what_ to perish? Any trees? Of
course not, he isn't referring to trees or animals or anything like that, but of
people. Ok, while we're being clear let's also get straight any of _which_
people? Notice what 2 Peter 3:8&ndash;9 says because we can answer that question
without having to leave the immediate context. Any of _those toward whom the
Lord is patient_. He is patient toward the "you" in those verses, the original
audience of Peter's epistles.

Please understand, I'm not being fancy with words. It's just a fact that Peter
didn't say that God desires the entire world to be saved. Instead he was talking
about the "elect exiles according to the foreknowledge of God the Father" to
whom he wrote {% include verse.html verse="1 Peter 1:1&ndash;2" %}.

People in the world today will find that Peter was talking about them too, but
only inasmuch as God the Father has caused them to be born again to salvation in
the mode of {% include verse.html verse="1 Peter 1:3" %}, just like Peter's
audience.

Why was the Lord patient with them? Because He desired all of them to reach
repentance. This has a couple of implications.

### Christians have need of repentance

First, not all of them had "reached repentance". This doesn't mean that they
lacked justification, though. Take
{% include verse.html verse="2 Corinthians 7:9" %} for example:

> As it is, I rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because you were
  grieved into _repenting_. For you felt a _godly grief_, so that you suffered
  no loss through us.

In 1 Corinthians the Apostle Paul had reminded them of the gospel and reminded
them of the right standing they had in Christ. In spite of all the things wrong
at that church (there were lots of things wrong!) he didn't indicate they had
lost a right standing with the Lord or that they had fallen away from grace, as
he came very close to saying to the entire Galatian church. Instead he reminded
the Corinthian church of the right standing they had in Jesus and then commanded
them to live accordingly.

Of particular note is
{% include verse.html verse="1 Corinthians 11:18&ndash;" %}:

> For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there
  are divisions among you. And I believe it in part, for there must be factions
  among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized.

There was a group of "genuine" people in the Corinthian church. I understand
that refers to a group of people who were elect unto salvation, were trusting in
Jesus, were justified before God through their faith in Jesus, etc.

Yet 2 Corinthians 7:9 shows there remained room for them to repent (in fact that
was evidently the reason Paul wrote his letters to them).

Even those destined for heaven have need for repentance. Recall also
{% include verse.html verse="1 John 1:8" %}:

> If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

Christians have need of repentance.

### It doesn't end the argument

Second, if the Lord desired them all to reach repentance, then does that
necessarily mean that they would all reach repentance?

Depends on what "repentance" means. Is it a single action? Or is it a series of
actions?

I don't think it's possible for it to mean a single action. Else the audience of
Peter's epistles wouldn't have it until they had reached it at some point later,
yet they were already elect to salvation. Is this circular?

Yet if it's a series of actions then there remained at least one action.

And why does Peter say some of them would perish without reaching this
"repentance"? Is that similar to the holiness without which no one will see the
Lord (Hebrews 12:14)?

Were they part of those Gentiles who had been granted "the repentance that leads
to life" (Acts 11:18)?
