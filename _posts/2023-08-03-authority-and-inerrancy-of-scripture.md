Matthew Barrett [wrote an essay on TGC](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/essay/authority-inerrancy-scripture/) titled
"The Authority and Inerrancy of Scripture".

## Summary of the article

Here is the definition and summary given by Barrett:

### Definition

> The doctrine of the authority and inerrancy of Scripture is that, as a corollary of the inspiration of Scripture, the
  God-breathed Scriptures are wholly true in all things that they assert in the original autographs and therefore
  function with the authority of Godâ€™s own words.

### Summary

> The doctrine of the authority and inerrancy of Scripture is rooted in the doctrine of God; as God is true and
  trustworthy, so is his word recorded in the original autographs of Scriptures. This means that all things that the
  Scriptures assert are wholly true, both in the Old Testament, the Scriptures of Jesus and the apostles, and in the New
  Testament, the writings of the apostles. So far as the original autographs have been faithfully copied, translated,
  and passed down, Scripture is inerrant in its copies. This inerrancy means that all things that the Scriptures assert
  function with the authority of Godâ€™s own Word for Christians.

## Study guide answers

These are my answers to a study guide given by my pastor. Hopefully my answers correctly summarize the essay.

1. When we say Scripture is inerrant, what are we speaking about?
   1. All ancient manuscripts
   1. All modern translations
   1. All the original autographs (i.e., what Moses, Paul, or other authors actually wrote)
   1. Scripture is inerrant in its message of faith
      > By saying that Scripture is inerrant we mean that all things _in the original autographs_ are wholly true.
1. How does the Doctrine of Inerrancy and Authority follow from our Doctrine of God? This one is for Matt since it can
   be expressed in a syllogism. ðŸ˜Š
   > These syllogisms express the doctrine of the inerrancy of scripture and apply it to modern translations:
   >
   > 1. God is true.
   > 1. Someone's word reflects their own truthfulness.
   > 1. Therefore God's word is true.
   >
   > 1. God's word is true.
   > 1. The original autographs were God's word.
   > 1. Therefore the original autographs were true.
   >
   > 1. Truthfulness is preserved in proportion to the faithfulness of a copy and translation.
   > 1. Most bibles we have today faithfully copy and translate the original autographs.
   > 1. Therefore most bibles we have today are nearly as true as the original autographs.
   >
   > 1. The original autographs were true.
   > 1. Most bibles we have today are nearly as true as the original autographs.
   > 1. Therefore most bibles we have today are very true.
   >
   > <br/>
   > An identical form of argument can be constructed to do the same with regard to the authority of scripture:
   >
   > 1. God has the highest authority.
   > 1. Someone's word carries their own authority.
   > 1. Therefore God's word has the highest authority.
   >
   > 1. God's word has the highest authority.
   > 1. The original autographs were God's word.
   > 1. Therefore the original autographs had the highest authority.
   >
   > 1. Authority is preserved in proportion to the faithfulness of a copy and translation.
   > 1. Most bibles we have today faithfully copy and translate the original autographs.
   > 1. Therefore most bibles we have today are nearly as authoritative as the original autographs.
   >
   > 1. The original autographs had the highest authority.
   > 1. Most bibles we have today are nearly as authoritative as the original autographs.
   > 1. Therefore most bibles we have today are very authoritative.
1. Is the doctrine of Scripture important? Why? What does B. B. Warfield say?
   > B. B. Warfield said:
   > > The trustworthiness of the Scriptures lies at the foundation of trust in the Christian system of doctrine, and
       is therefore fundamental to the Christian hope and life.
   >
   > By that he means that our trust in the preacher of God's word hinges on our trust of what he is preaching, and our
   > obligation to it hinges on the authority of the source he is expositing. In this way, faith and practice both
   > depend on the doctrine of scripture.
   >
   > There is another reason this doctrine is important. Our beliefs about scripture influence and are founded on our
   > beliefs about God. If we believe that the scriptures are not truthful or authoritative, then we necessarily must
   > believe that God is neither truthful nor authoritative. And we ought not want to ascribe false things to God.
1. Does the human authorship of Scripture undermine the doctrine of inerrancy? Why or why not?
   > While at first blush the human authorship of scripture might seem to undermine the doctrine of inerrancy, in fact
     it does not. Instead, we recognize that humans are only the _secondary_ author of scripture and God is the
     _primary_ author. Since God is the primary author his own personal attributes are reflected and preserved in his
     word, as the syllogisms above demonstrate.
   >
   > It can be helpful to think in terms of the communicability of an attribute of God. Certain attributes of God, such
     as his self-existence, cannot be transferred to other things. But certain other attributes of God, such as
     truthfulness, may indeed be transferred to other things. And human authors "carried along by the Holy Spirit"
     would not have inhibited God in this process. Instead they were part of the means and mechanism by which God
     transferred his truthfulness to scripture.
1. How would you describe Jesusâ€™ view of the Scriptures? Why does this matter?
   > Jesus esteemed the scriptures very highly. He always treated the Old Testament with utter trust and reverence. This
     can be seen by his numerous references to and usages of it. For example:
   > > until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is
       accomplished&mdash;Matthew 5:18
   >
   > > Scripture cannot be broken&mdash;John 10:35
   >
   > Jesus also made scripture the bedrock of many of his responses and much of his reasoning. Just skim through the New
   > Testament to see how often Jesus said "have you not read" and "it is written". Jesus's success against the devil's
   > temptations saliently highlights how much Jesus lived by God's word.
   >
   > Jesus brings a unique credibility to the question of the scriptures. In him himself God's word has proven true, and
   > he himself holds God's word in very high esteem. Therefore, inasmuch as we trust these things about Jesus, our
   > trust in God's word may be bolstered.
1. The word "plenary" means unqualified and absolute. Barrett says, "Just as inspiration is both verbal and plenary, so
   too is inerrancy." What view does he describe that rejects plenary inspiration? How should we respond to this
   approach?
   > Barrett describes a limited inerrancy view which rejects plenary inspiration. People who hold this view believe
     that scripture is only inerrant with regard to its message of faith. But with regard to other matters (for example
     matters that overlap with modern scientific investigation) they leave room for other authorities (for example
     modern scientific inquiry) to be a higher arbiter of truth.
   >
   > This limited inerrancy view undermines the doctrine of
     [_sola scriptura_](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/understanding-sola-scriptura), which states that God's
     word is the final authority and ultimate standard for all of life.
   >
   > This limited view is also either self-defeating or else leads to a pitiable state. Who decides what a "matter of
     faith" is? Is the statement "Jesus rose from the dead" a matter of faith, or is it a matter of history? Those who
     hold the view of limited inerrancy are forced to say it has no overlap with and is unknowable by historical
     inquiry. Yet historical inquiry is at the very heart of true Christian thought (1 Corinthians 15). And therein lies
     the fault in the limited view. If historical inquiry trumps this matter of faith, then secular historians might
     very well conclude (rightly or wrongly&mdash;who's to say if God's word isn't the judge?) that Jesus never rose
     from the dead, and so the Christian who holds this view "is of all people most to be pitied" (1 Corinthians 15:19).
     On the other hand if scripture trumps secular historical inquiry, then it is not true that scripture is inerrant
     _only_ with regard to matters of faith, and the view is self-defeating.
   >
   > Therefore we ought to reject the limited view of inerrancy.
