          <h1>Terraforming Clouds</h1>
          
          
          <p><i>August 16, 2021&mdash;First impressions of Terraform in Azure</i></p>
          
          <p><a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> is a software tool for “infrastructure as
code”. “Infrastructure as code” just means that you deploy cloud resources
(databases, applications, and how they’re wired together) with a configuration
file. Terraform is a tool which reads its brand of configuration file and can
interact with several different clouds (Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, etc).</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The good</h2>

<p>Once you learn how to write Terraform configuration files you can put them into
source control and create a continuous integration pipeline so that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can fearlessly change cloud resources</li>
  <li>Cloud resources are always in sync with source code</li>
  <li>You can easily revert to a previous version of source code <em>and</em> a previous
cloud setup</li>
</ul>

<p>These are real benefits. You can have a continuous integration pipeline that
builds and tests your application, and then deploys it to the cloud while making
sure all the necessary infrastructure is in place and configured properly.</p>

<p>And it’s awesome being able to put all the infrastructure in source control. It
feels a lot less fragile.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2>

<p>You can’t do everything with Terraform; in theory it lags behind. When Azure
comes out with something new then someone from Microsoft has to update the
Terraform
<a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs">“plugin” for Azure</a>.
To be honest this isn’t a problem for me.</p>

<p>Terraform will not show mercy to cloud resources that it controls. If you remove
a database from your configuration file then Terraform will not think twice
about deleting it. So make sure you keep regular backups (you would be doing
that anyway, right?) and in a storage container that isn’t under Terraform’s
control (otherwise your fat fingers will make it delete all your backups, too!)</p>

<p>There is a learning curve.</p>

<h2 id="the-ugly">The ugly</h2>

<p>I’m not really sure how I would improve Terraform. The configuration language is
okay. The tooling feels complete. There is documentation for everything.</p>

<h2 id="the-point">The point</h2>

<p>I think I’m going to use infrastructure as code techniques in all my future
cloud projects. You should, too!</p>

<p>Would I use Terraform? Probably. I need to finish learning about
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/infrastructure-as-code#azure-resource-manager-templates">Azure Resource Manager Templates</a>.
Apparently Microsoft has a native solution for infrastructure as code, and I
might prefer that over Terraform.</p>
